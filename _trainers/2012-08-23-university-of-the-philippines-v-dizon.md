## Recite the basic parties and nature of the dispute in this case.

<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
Begin by identifying the parties and the procedural posture. The petitioners are the University of the Philippines (UP) and then-incumbent UP officials (including Jose V. Abueva and others). The respondents are Hon. Agustin S. Dizon in his capacity as Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 80, Quezon City, Stern Builders, Inc., and Servillano Dela Cruz. The core dispute arises from a construction contract (a General Construction Agreement entered into on August 30, 1990) between UP and Stern Builders for extensions and renovation at the UP Los Baños campus. Stern Builders submitted three progress billings; UP paid two but refused the third because the Commission on Audit (COA) initially disallowed it. After COA allegedly lifted the disallowance, UP still did not pay, prompting Stern Builders and Dela Cruz to sue UP and its officials to collect the unpaid billing and to recover additional damages. The RTC rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, which was later executed by garnishing UP funds. The case ultimately reached the Supreme Court on petition by UP contesting (among other things) the garnishment of UP funds and the validity of substantial awards of damages and attorney’s fees.</p>

## What contract and project gave rise to the controversy? Provide the relevant dates and parties.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The controversy stems from a General Construction Agreement dated August 30, 1990, between the University of the Philippines and Stern Builders Corporation, represented by Servillano Dela Cruz. The contract concerned construction of the extension building and the renovation of the College of Arts and Sciences Building at the UP Los Baños campus. The implementation produced progress billings from Stern Builders; the dispute centers on the third billing worth ₱273,729.47 which UP did not pay after an initial disallowance by the COA. This nonpayment set off the pleadings and litigation culminating in the RTC decision, writ of execution and garnishment, and the eventual Supreme Court review.</p>
</details>

## What procedural steps did Stern Builders and Dela Cruz take after the UP failed to pay the third billing?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
When UP refused payment of the third billing, Stern Builders and Dela Cruz filed suit against UP and its officials in the RTC of Quezon City (Civil Case No. Q-93-14971). They sought to collect the unpaid billing and to recover additional damages for what they alleged were the consequences of UP’s refusal to pay. After trial, the RTC ruled in favor of plaintiffs on November 28, 2001, awarding the unpaid billing and substantial damages, and later issued writs of execution and notices of garnishment to enforce the judgment. Subsequent motions for execution, garnishment notices to UP’s banks, and motions to release or to quash the writs followed as the parties litigated enforcement.</p>

## State the RTC’s judgment of November 28, 2001 — what reliefs were awarded?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The RTC, in its decision of November 28, 2001, ordered the UP and its co-defendants, jointly and severally, to pay the plaintiffs the following: (1) ₱503,462.74 for the third billing, additional work and retention money; (2) ₱5,716,729.00 as actual damages; (3) ₱10,000,000.00 as moral damages; (4) attorney’s fees of ₱150,000.00 and ₱1,500.00 per appearance; and (5) costs of suit. Those amounts were later the focus of enforcement by writ of execution and garnishment against funds of UP deposited in its depository banks.</p>

## Outline the appellate and post-judgment procedural timeline from the RTC decision to the Supreme Court petition.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
After the RTC decision, UP filed a motion for reconsideration which the RTC denied on May 7, 2002. UP filed a notice of appeal on June 3, 2002; Stern Builders opposed as late and sought execution. The RTC, on September 26, 2002, denied due course to the notice of appeal as out-of-time and granted a motion for execution. A writ of execution issued October 4, 2002, and the sheriff served it on UP on October 9, 2002. UP filed motions (to reconsider, to quash, restrain) that the RTC denied. UP elevated the denial of due course to the Court of Appeals via certiorari (CA-G.R. No. 77395) on June 24, 2003, but the CA dismissed it on February 24, 2004 for tardy filing. UP filed a petition for review on certiorari to the Supreme Court (G.R. No. 163501) on May 11, 2004 which the Court denied on June 23, 2004, and UP’s motion for reconsideration was denied October 6, 2004; that denial became final November 12, 2004. Meanwhile, the RTC issued writs of execution and notices of garnishment to UP’s banks (DBP and Land Bank), and various RTC orders alternately authorized or restricted release of funds. The Court of Appeals issued a TRO on January 19, 2005; later it dismissed the UP’s CA petition on September 16, 2005. UP then unsuccessfully sought relief from the RTC and eventually filed a petition for certiorari in the CA (CA-G.R. CV No. 88125) and ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court, which resulted in the August 23, 2012 decision now under study.</p>
</details>

## Describe how and when writs of execution and garnishment were utilized in this case.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
Following the RTC’s grant of a motion for execution, the court issued a writ of execution on October 4, 2002, and the sheriff served the writ and notice of demand upon UP on October 9, 2002. Stern Builders pursued enforcement by asking the sheriff to serve notices of garnishment upon UP’s depository banks. Garnishment notices were served on Land Bank of the Philippines (Buendia Branch) and Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), Commonwealth Branch, on June 23 and July 25, 2003, respectively. These garnishments resulted in funds of UP being earmarked and held, and later in orders directing DBP to release the garnished amounts to Stern Builders and Dela Cruz, subject to litigation over the propriety of such release and whether government funds could be garnished without adherence to COA procedures and appropriations law.</p>
</details>

## What were the principal legal contentions asserted by the University of the Philippines to resist garnishment?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
UP argued principally that its deposits at Land Bank and DBP were government funds and public in character, hence not subject to garnishment or seizure absent an appropriation by Congress and compliance with the COA’s procedures under Presidential Decree No. 1445 (Government Auditing Code). UP relied on precedents like Department of Agriculture v. NLRC and University of the Philippines Board of Regents v. Ligot-Telan to assert that government funds cannot be released simply by a court order for execution without observing the constitutional and statutory budgeting and audit processes. It also argued that the amounts earmarked for the construction project were trust funds to be spent only for the purposes for which they were created, and that awards such as moral and actual damages and attorney’s fees fall outside the earmarked appropriation and therefore should not have been satisfied by treasury or trust funds without COA settlement or congressional appropriation. UP further claimed denial of due process in some of the enforcement steps and faulted the RTC for acting with lack of judicial restraint and for failing to observe PD No. 1445 and the Court’s Administrative Circular advising caution in executing judgments against government entities.</p>
</details>

## How did the Court of Appeals rule regarding the garnishment of UP funds, and what was its rationale?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Court of Appeals dismissed UP’s certiorari petition challenging the RTC’s orders directing the garnishment and release of funds. The CA reasoned that the funds at issue had been already earmarked for the specific construction project and that UP held them only in a fiduciary capacity pending completion; therefore, there was no need for further appropriations for payment. The CA agreed with the RTC’s observations including reference to Executive Order No. 109 and guidelines indicating that certain accounts payable reverted to the Cumulative Result of Operations might be paid upon administrative determination of validity. The CA thus concluded that the funds were properly subject to garnishment to satisfy the judgment because they were already allocated to the project and were being held by UP in fiduciary capacity rather than constituting general public funds inaccessible to execution.</p>
</details>

## Summarize the University’s principal assignments of error in its petition to the Supreme Court.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
UP raised multiple assignments of error before the Supreme Court; the principal ones included: (I) that the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing UP’s petition and in effectively allowing garnishment of UP funds by ruling that funds had already been earmarked for the project such that no further appropriation was necessary; (II) that permitting garnishment violated Article XIV, Section 5(5) of the Constitution concerning the protection of state universities’ funds; (III) in the alternative, UP sought equity and asked this Court to modify or delete the ₱10 million moral damages award; (IV) that the RTC (Branch 80) committed grave error in ordering immediate release of the judgment award on January 3, 2007 based on equity and judicial courtesy; (V) that the RTC erred again in ordering immediate release on January 16, 2007 even though UP still had pending reconsideration; and (VI) that the RTC should have ordered redeposit of the garnished funds in violation of the Supreme Court’s TRO of January 24, 2007. Underlying many of these assignments was the contention that government trust funds cannot be garnished without complying with COA procedures and appropriations law, and that substantial damage awards lacked factual and legal foundation.</p>
</details>

## What is the Supreme Court’s threshold holding on whether UP funds are subject to garnishment?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Supreme Court held categorically that UP’s funds are government funds and public in character, forming special trust funds that must be used solely for the purposes for which they were created and are subject to audit by the COA. Consequently, such funds are not the proper subject of garnishment or execution to satisfy monetary judgments unless the settlement and appropriation requirements set by law have been observed. The Court emphasized the distinction between the State’s suability and its liability and explained that suability does not automatically authorize immediate execution against government funds. The proper procedure requires that claims against the government be subjected first to the primary jurisdiction of the COA pursuant to P.D. No. 1445 (Section 26) for audit and settlement before execution may proceed, and that payments from public funds must be in pursuance of appropriation by law (Section 29(1), Article VI of the Constitution).</p>
</details>

## Explain how the Court characterized the University of the Philippines — private corporation, state instrumentality, or otherwise — and the legal significance of that characterization.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Court described the University of the Philippines as a chartered institution and a government instrumentality, not a private profit-making corporation. Established under Act 1870 and later recognized as the national university by R.A. No. 9500, UP performs a governmental function — promoting education as part of the State’s constitutional mandate. The legal significance is pivotal: because UP is a government instrumentality administering special funds (fees, incomes, and appropriations), all its funds are characterized as special trust funds disbursable only for the institutional objectives for which they are held and subject to COA audit and settlement. This characterization informs the Court’s holding that UP’s funds are public and cannot be garnished or levied outside the procedures and budgetary constraints established for government funds.</p>
</details>

## What provision of Presidential Decree No. 1445 did the Court emphasize, and why is it central to the decision?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Court emphasized Section 26 of Presidential Decree No. 1445, the Government Auditing Code, which grants the Commission on Audit (COA) general jurisdiction to examine, audit and settle accounts and claims of any sort due from the Government or any of its subdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities. The Court made this provision central because it establishes the COA’s primary jurisdiction over monetary claims against the government and prescribes that such claims must be examined and settled by COA prior to execution against government funds. Therefore, issuance of writs of execution and garnishment against government funds without COA involvement contravenes PD No. 1445 and is improper. The Court held that the execution of monetary judgments against UP was within COA’s primary jurisdiction, making immediate execution against UP funds unlawful in the absence of COA settlement or other statutory authority.</p>
</details>

## How did the Court distinguish between the State’s suability and the State’s liability?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Court reiterated a well-established distinction: suability concerns consent of the State to be sued; liability depends on applicable law and the facts proving responsibility. Allowing the State to be sued does not automatically subject its funds to immediate seizure; the law can limit claimants’ remedies so that, even if the State is amenable to suit, enforcement is regulated by special procedures. The Court cited precedent noting that when the State waives sovereign immunity to be sued, it may nonetheless require that the pursuit of enforcement be restricted “only up to the completion of proceedings anterior to the stage of execution,” meaning that execution or seizure of government funds must respect statutory controls like COA settlement and appropriation requirements. Therefore, UP’s suability did not translate into an unfettered right of Stern Builders to execute against UP funds without following those statutory procedures.</p>
</details>

## What practical and constitutional reasons did the Court give for prohibiting immediate garnishment of government funds?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Court articulated both practical and constitutional rationales. Practically, disbursement of public funds must be covered by the corresponding appropriation as required by the Constitution; allowing courts to directly seize government funds could disrupt essential governmental functions by diverting funds from their legitimate, specific objects. Constitutionally, Section 29(1) of Article VI mandates that no money may be paid out of the Treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law. Additionally, trust funds are to be used only for purposes for which they were created, and subject to COA auditing authority under PD No. 1445. Together these considerations form the public policy basis for restricting direct execution against government funds and funneling claims through COA and appropriation processes to protect the administration of public services and fiscal discipline.</p>
</details>

## Did the Court accept the Court of Appeals’ view that the funds were merely “earmarked” and held in fiduciary capacity and therefore subject to garnishment? Explain.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
No. The Supreme Court rejected the CA’s reasoning that the funds were “earmarked” for the construction project and held in a fiduciary capacity such that no congressional appropriation was necessary to pay the plaintiffs. The Court found this conclusion unlawful because it overlooked the statutory and constitutional constraints on the use of government trust funds. The Court stressed that even if funds were set aside for a project, they remain government trust funds and their disbursement must comply with COA settlement rules and applicable budgetary laws. The CA’s approach effectively bypassed COA’s primary jurisdiction under PD No. 1445 and the Constitution’s requirement regarding appropriations. Thus, the SC reversed the CA to the extent it approved garnishment without observing COA and appropriation procedures.</p>
</details>

## How did the Court treat the RTC orders that permitted withdrawal of the garnished funds (e.g., January 3 and January 16, 2007 orders of Judge Yadao)?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Supreme Court found that the RTC acted beyond its jurisdiction when it ordered immediate withdrawal and release of the garnished funds. The Court declared void the succeeding orders and actions allowing or effecting withdrawal, specifically: Judge Yadao’s January 3, 2007 order allowing Stern Builders and Dela Cruz to withdraw the deposited garnished amount; Judge Yadao’s January 16, 2007 order directing DBP to release the garnished amount; the sheriff’s report of January 17, 2007 manifesting full satisfaction; and the April 10, 2007 order denying UP’s motion to redeposit. The Court reasoned that trial judges should not immediately issue writs of execution or garnishment against the Government or its instrumentalities; the COA must first adjudicate and settle claims, and release of government funds without observing PD No. 1445 was void. Accordingly, the RTC’s orders authorizing withdrawal were struck down as without legal effect.</p>
</details>

## What administrative warning had been circulated to judges concerning execution against government agencies, and how did the Court treat the RTC’s compliance with it?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Court cited Administrative Circular No. 10-2000, dated October 25, 2000, which enjoined judges to observe “utmost caution, prudence and judiciousness” in issuing writs of execution to satisfy money judgments against government agencies and local government units, explicitly to prevent circumvention of COA rules under PD No. 1445. The Supreme Court criticized Judge Yadao for disregarding PD No. 1445 and the Circular; it found it troubling that a judge would act dismissively toward a public law that was designed precisely to regulate enforcement against government funds. The Court concluded that Judge Yadao’s actions showed a failure to comply with the Circular’s admonition, thereby contributing to the unlawful release of UP funds and to orders that were void and of no legal effect.</p>
</details>

## Discuss the Court’s ruling on the COA’s primary jurisdiction over monetary claims against the government. What are the practical consequences for claimants?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Court reaffirmed that COA has primary jurisdiction to examine, audit and settle all debts and claims due from the Government or any of its subdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities pursuant to Section 26 of PD No. 1445. Practically, this means claimants who obtain a judgment against a government entity cannot immediately execute against government funds. Instead, the claimant must present the monetary claim to COA for audit and settlement. Only after COA acts (either approves the claim or denies it, enabling further remedies) can execution proceed in conformity with the law. The Court emphasized that COA’s role remains essential even when a court has rendered a final judgment; COA must still determine the propriety of payment from government trust funds before any release or garnishment may be effectual. Failure to comply with this process renders enforcement orders void.</p>
</details>

## The UP contested the finality of the RTC judgment on appeal timeliness grounds. How did the Supreme Court resolve the question whether the UP’s notice of appeal was timely?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Supreme Court found in UP’s favor on the timeliness issue. First, the Court held that service of the order denying the motion for reconsideration must be made upon counsel of record — which in UP’s case was the Office of the Legal Services (OLS) in Diliman, not Atty. Felimon D. Nolasco in UPLB. Since the copy was served on Atty. Nolasco on May 17, 2002 but the OLS only received it on May 31, 2002, the appellate period resumed only after service on OLS, i.e., June 1, 2002; therefore the UP’s notice of appeal filed on June 3, 2002 was timely. Second, even assuming service upon Atty. Nolasco was valid, the Supreme Court applied retroactively the “fresh-period” rule announced in Neypes v. Court of Appeals (allowing a fresh 15‑day period to file notice of appeal from receipt of the denial of motion for new trial or reconsideration). Under that rule the UP still had until June 3, 2002 to file its notice because the fresh period would have extended through the next working day when it ended on a Saturday. Consequently, the Court concluded that the earlier determinations of finality (by the RTC and CA) were erroneous and set aside the declaration of finality on those bases.</p>
</details>

## Explain the “fresh-period” rule (Neypes rule) and why the Supreme Court applied it retroactively in this case.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The “fresh-period” rule, articulated in Neypes v. Court of Appeals, standardizes appeal periods by granting a fresh period — 15 days — within which to file a notice of appeal from receipt of the order denying a motion for new trial or motion for reconsideration. The Supreme Court applied this rule retroactively to UP’s case for equitable reasons. The Court reasoned that procedural rules do not create vested rights and that retroactive application of a procedural change that benefits litigants is permissible, especially when it furthers fair administration of justice. The Court also invoked equity—denying UP the benefit of the fresh-period rule would have led to an unjust and absurd result, as earlier recipients of similar orders would benefit while later recipients would not. Therefore, retroactive application remedied the procedural injustice that led to an improper declaration of finality, allowing the UP’s appeal filing date to be treated as timely under the renewed counting rule.</p>
</details>

## What constitutional and Rules of Court provisions did the Court rely upon in assessing the validity of the RTC’s findings supporting the awards of actual and moral damages and attorney’s fees?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Court relied heavily on Section 14, Article VIII of the Constitution, which requires that court decisions clearly and distinctly state the facts and the law on which they are based. It also invoked Section 1 of Rule 36, Rules of Court, which requires judgments to be in writing, personally prepared by the judge, and to state clearly and distinctly the facts and law on which they are based. The Court emphasized that findings of fact must include evidentiary facts, not just conclusions, so the losing party (or an appellate court) can identify possible errors. These provisions were central in evaluating whether the RTC adequately supported its awards of actual damages (Article 2199 Civil Code), moral damages (Article 2217 Civil Code), and attorney’s fees (Article 2208 Civil Code). The Court found the RTC’s body of decision deficient in the essential detailed factual and legal underpinnings for those substantial awards, rendering them speculative and void.</p>
</details>

## Why did the Supreme Court delete the awards of actual damages, moral damages, and attorney’s fees from the RTC’s judgment?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Supreme Court deleted those awards because the RTC’s decision did not contain clear and distinct findings of fact and law to justify them. For actual damages (₱5,716,729.00), the Court noted the RTC provided only a conclusory statement that the plaintiffs suffered losses and re‑mortgaged properties, but failed to enumerate or substantiate the specific pecuniary losses in accordance with Article 2199 of the Civil Code which requires proof of pecuniary loss. Without evidentiary support, the award was speculative. For moral damages (₱10,000,000.00), the award lacked factual basis and was unconscionable; moreover, corporate entities like Stern Builders cannot suffer moral anguish, and any claim by Dela Cruz as an individual was not properly separated from the corporation. For attorney’s fees (₱150,000.00 plus ₱1,500.00 per appearance), the Court held that the award must be grounded in specific provisions of Article 2208 or other legal bases and must be supported by findings; the RTC had not done so. The absence of constitutionally required findings rendered these awards void for lack of jurisdictional compliance and was a grave abuse of discretion.</p>
</details>

## Which part of the RTC judgment survived the Supreme Court’s deletion, and what caveat did the Court place on it?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Supreme Court allowed to stand the RTC award of ₱503,462.74 covering the third billing, additional completed work and retention money. However, the Court made that award subject to COA action — meaning that even this portion of the award was not to be enforced by direct execution against UP’s trust funds without COA examination and settlement as provided in PD No. 1445. Consequently, Stern Builders and Dela Cruz were ordered to redeposit the amount of ₱16,370,191.74 (the garnished funds) within ten days and the costs of suit were imposed on the private respondents, reflecting the Court’s direction to restore the status quo pending proper COA processes.</p>
</details>

## What did the Supreme Court order Stern Builders and Dela Cruz to do with the funds already withdrawn, and within what period?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Supreme Court ordered Stern Builders Corporation and Servillano Dela Cruz to redeposit the amount of ₱16,370,191.74 — the funds that had been garnished and then withdrawn — within ten days from receipt of the Supreme Court decision. The Court also imposed the costs of suit on the private respondents. This remedial order was intended to correct the unauthorized release and to place the funds back pending proper COA determination and compliance with appropriate legal and budgetary procedures.</p>
</details>

## How did the Court treat the argument that the RTC had to be afforded “judicial courtesy” and equity in releasing the funds during the pendency of UP’s higher-court remedies?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Supreme Court rejected the notion that “judicial courtesy” or equity justified the RTC’s orders releasing the garnished funds while UP’s remedies were pending. The Court stressed that judges do not need a writ of preliminary injunction from a superior tribunal to comply with the law; adherence to PD No. 1445 and the Administrative Circular is mandatory. A trial court’s equitable or courteous motive cannot supersede statutory restrictions protecting public trust funds. The Court was critical of the RTC’s dismissal of COA jurisdiction and its willingness to authorize release on equitable grounds — particularly when COA’s mandate and appropriations requirements were bypassed — and found such actions to be beyond the court’s jurisdiction and therefore void.</p>
</details>

## What are the doctrinal exceptions to the immutability of a final and executory judgment identified or referenced by the Court in this case?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Court acknowledged that while final judgments are generally immutable, there are recognized exceptions: (a) correction of clerical errors; (b) nunc pro tunc entries that cause no prejudice; (c) judgments that are void; and (d) circumstances arising after finality that render execution unjust or inequitable. The Court also indicated that in exceptional situations the Court may disregard procedural strictures to serve higher interests of justice and equity. In this case, the Court treated the defective service leading to miscounting of appeal time and the constitutional due process failure in the RTC decision as circumstances warranting deviation from strict finality, allowing the Supreme Court to intervene to prevent injustice and to vindicate the statutory protection of government funds.</p>
</details>

## What statutory and constitutional provisions did the Court cite to support its ruling that no money may be paid out of the Treasury except in pursuance of appropriation?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Court cited Section 29(1) of Article VI of the Constitution which provides that no money shall be paid out of the Treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law. Additionally, the Court relied on P.D. No. 1445 (Government Auditing Code) which controls auditing and settlement of government accounts and claims, and Section 84(2) of PD No. 1445 addressing the handling of revenue and trust funds. Together these provisions underscore that public funds disbursement must observe appropriation laws and COA processes, thereby prohibiting courts from directing immediate payment out of government trust funds absent statutory authority or COA settlement.</p>
</details>

## How did the Court evaluate Stern Builders’ contention that the contract price had been adjusted and thus sufficient to cover the judgment award?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
While Stern Builders contended the contract price had been adjusted and exceeded the judgment amount, the Supreme Court did not accept this as a reason to permit garnishment or to bypass COA and appropriations requirements. The Court emphasized that even if funds were allocated or the contract price adjusted, those funds remained government trust funds subject to COA oversight and appropriation rules. The presence of an allocation for a project does not allow a private party to enforce a judgment by immediate garnishment against government funds; the settlement and disbursement must still adhere to PD No. 1445 and constitutional appropriation requirements. Therefore, the alleged adequacy of the contract price did not validate the garnishment or the RTC’s orders authorizing release.</p>
</details>

## What role did the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) play in this litigation, and how did the Court deal with DBP’s actions?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
DBP, as one of UP’s depository banks, received notices of garnishment and later complied with an RTC order by delivering a manager’s check for ₱16,370,191.74 payable to Stern Builders and Dela Cruz, which the sheriff accepted. DBP also filed a motion to consign the check and to dismiss any contempt proceeding for noncompliance. The Supreme Court’s ruling required that the withdrawn funds be redeposited to correct the unauthorized release; costs were imposed on private respondents. The Court’s analysis implied that DBP, as a garnishee, had acted upon court orders, but because those orders were declared void for contravening PD No. 1445 and appropriations law, any releases effected under them were likewise invalid and required restitution through redeposit.</p>
</details>

## How did the Court treat the CA’s and RTC’s procedural handling of service of the order denying the motion for reconsideration?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Court found that service of the denial on Atty. Nolasco of the UPLB Legal Office was ineffective because the counsel of record for UP was the Office of Legal Services (OLS) in Diliman, and service must be upon counsel of record. Because the OLS only received the order on May 31, 2002, the period for filing an appeal resumed only from that date. This error in service meant that the RTC and CA wrongly declared the judgment final on grounds of tardiness. By correcting the service defect and applying the fresh-period rule, the Supreme Court concluded UP’s notice of appeal filed on June 3, 2002 was timely. The Court stressed the rule that when a party appears by counsel, service must be made upon counsel (Rule 13, Rule 22, Rules of Court), and service on an employee or other counsel is not notice in law.</p>
</details>

## What legal consequences did the Court impose on Stern Builders and Dela Cruz for having accepted or used the withdrawn funds?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Court ordered Stern Builders Corporation and Servillano Dela Cruz to redeposit the amount of ₱16,370,191.74 within ten days from receipt of the decision. The Court also imposed costs of suit on the private respondents. These consequences were necessitated by the Court’s determination that the RTC orders directing the release were void and the withdrawal was effectuated without compliance with PD No. 1445 and appropriation requirements. The redeposit order effectively seeks to restore the status quo and ensure that the funds remain available for proper COA determination or other lawful disposition.</p>
</details>

## Was the Supreme Court willing to entertain UP’s request to delete or reduce the award of moral damages on equitable grounds despite finality? Explain.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Supreme Court was receptive to reducing or deleting the moral damages award, but not on pure equitable grounds alone; rather, the Court found the award infirm for lack of constitutionally required findings of fact and law. The Court explained that while finality is generally immutable, exceptions exist and equity permits intervention when necessary. In UP’s case, the moral damages award of ₱10,000,000.00 lacked factual support and violated legal principles (e.g., corporate entities cannot suffer moral anguish), making it speculative, unconscionable and legally indefensible. Therefore, the Court deleted the award because of these substantive and procedural deficiencies rather than merely exercising broad equitable revision of a validly supported award.</p>
</details>

## How did the Court reconcile the need for finality of judgments with its decision to set aside certain parts of the RTC judgment?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Court acknowledged the importance of finality but emphasized that finality cannot trump fundamental legal requirements, such as due process and the constitutional demand that decisions state the facts and law on which they are based. Where a judgment is void for lack of jurisdiction, or where awards are speculative because they lack necessary factual findings, the doctrine of immutability yields. Moreover, the Court invoked recognized exceptions to finality — e.g., void judgments and situations where enforcement would be unjust — and applied them because the awards of damages and fees did not meet constitutional and legal standards. Thus, the Court balanced finality against the imperative to uphold procedural and substantive legal standards and to prevent unjust enforcement actions against public funds.</p>

## According to the Court, what requirements must be satisfied before attorney’s fees may be awarded and upheld?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
Attorney’s fees, generally not recoverable absent stipulation, may be awarded under Article 2208 of the Civil Code in enumerated circumstances (e.g., exemplary damages, defendant’s conduct compelling litigation with third persons, gross bad faith, etc.), and in any other case where the court deems it just and equitable. However, even where such fees are permitted, the award must be supported by specific factual findings and legal justification in the body of the decision, not merely stated in the decretal portion. The Supreme Court found that the RTC did not provide the factual and legal bases necessary to bring the case within the Article’s exceptions; it merely announced attorney’s fees in the dispositive portion. This lack of findings rendered the award void and subject to deletion.</p>

## What doctrinal teaching did the Court reiterate about the necessity for courts to state supporting evidentiary facts in their judgments?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Court reiterated that the Constitution and the Rules of Court mandate that judgments must state clearly and distinctly both the facts and the law on which they are based, and that findings of fact must include evidentiary facts and not merely conclusions. The reason is to inform parties of the rationale for the decision so that appeals or other remedies can be meaningfully pursued, and to ensure the requirements of due process are met. A judgment that lacks such supporting facts is a patent nullity because it deprives the losing party of the ability to discern errors for appellate review and fails to justify extraordinary remedial awards like large sums for moral or actual damages. Hence, a judge’s ipse dixit — a bare conclusion — is insufficient.</p>

## Summarize the final disposition ordered by the Supreme Court in this case.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Supreme Court granted UP’s petition for review on certiorari and reversed and set aside the Court of Appeals decision under review. It annulled the orders for garnishment of UP funds and for release of the garnished amount to Stern Builders and Dela Cruz. The Court deleted from the RTC decision the awards of actual damages (₱5,716,729.00), moral damages (₱10,000,000.00), and attorney’s fees (₱150,000.00 plus ₱1,500.00 per appearance) as void. The RTC award of ₱503,462.74 remained but was subject to COA action. The Court ordered Stern Builders and Dela Cruz to redeposit ₱16,370,191.74 within ten days from receipt of the decision and assessed costs of suit against the private respondents. Thus, the Court effectively restored control over the funds to UP pending proper administrative and statutory procedures.</p>

## What lessons did the Supreme Court intend judges to take away from this decision regarding writs of execution and garnishment against the government?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Supreme Court intended to remind trial judges that they should not hastily issue writs of execution or garnishment to enforce money judgments against the Government or any of its subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities. Judges must bear in mind the COA’s primary jurisdiction over claims against the government and the constitutional constraints on public funds’ disbursement. The Court emphasized adherence to Administrative Circular No. 10-2000 and PD No. 1445, urging judges to exercise utmost caution, prudence and judiciousness so as not to circumvent COA procedures or the appropriation requirement. The decision reinforced that judicial zeal to enforce judgments must be balanced against statutory protections of public funds and the separation of functions among the courts, COA, and the legislative appropriation power.</p>

## If a claimant obtains a final judgment against a government agency, what procedural pathway did the Court indicate the claimant must follow before execution against public funds can occur?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Court indicated that claimants must first present their monetary claims to the Commission on Audit, which has primary jurisdiction to examine, audit, and settle such claims under Section 26 of PD No. 1445. Even after a final judicial determination, COA must act on the claim to authorize payment from public or trust funds. Only after COA’s settlement — and subject to appropriations law where necessary — may funds be disbursed to satisfy the judgment. The claimant cannot unilaterally enforce the judgment by garnishing government funds before COA’s action and without the proper appropriations. This pathway preserves fiscal discipline and ensures that public funds are disbursed only in accordance with legal and budgetary rules.</p>

## How did the Court address Stern Builders’ claim regarding the injury and hardships it and its president allegedly suffered?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
Stern Builders and Dela Cruz asserted that they suffered severe hardships — loss of income, sale of house and equipment, and suffering — warranting the awards of actual and moral damages. The Supreme Court did not deny that hardships may have occurred, but it stressed that the RTC’s decision failed to particularize and substantiate the claimed pecuniary losses and mental anguish with evidentiary findings. For actual damages, Article 2199 required proof of specific pecuniary loss; for moral damages, the Court noted the incongruity of awarding large sums without factual support, and that a corporation cannot suffer moral anguish. The Court concluded that because the record lacked clear supporting findings, the awards were speculative and had to be deleted. The remedy was not to disbelieve the plaintiffs’ suffering per se but to insist upon the constitutionally required specificity in findings to justify monetary awards.</p>

## What did the Court say about the legal effect of the sheriff’s report that manifested full satisfaction of the writ of execution?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Court held that the sheriff’s report declaring full satisfaction of the writ, based on the withdrawal of the garnished funds under orders later found void, cannot validate or cure the illegality of the prior judicial orders. Because the orders authorizing release were void for contravening PD No. 1445 and appropriation requirements, the sheriff’s report and any subsequent appearance of satisfaction were without legal effect. The proper remedy was redeposit of the wrongfully withdrawn funds and annulment of the subsequent enforcement records produced under the void orders. Thus, the sheriff’s report could not stand as a lawful basis to deny relief to UP.</p>

## Considering this case, what obligations rest upon counsel representing government agencies when receiving court processes?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
Counsel representing government agencies must ensure they are the counsel of record and receive proper service of court processes; service must be made upon the counsel of record in accordance with the Rules of Court. The Supreme Court underscored that service upon a party’s employee or a different counsel not of record is ineffective. In this case, because the Office of Legal Services in Diliman was the counsel of record for UP, service upon Atty. Nolasco at UPLB was not notice in law. Accurate identification and receipt of court processes are critical because they determine the running of appeal periods and other procedural timelines; mistakes in service can result in deprivation of procedural rights or loss of remedies, and courts may, where equitable, correct such errors as happened here.</p>

## Provide a concise statement of the legal principles a Philippine trial judge must follow when confronted with motions for execution against a government instrumentality.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
A Philippine trial judge must (1) recognize the COA’s primary jurisdiction over audits and settlement of claims against government entities under P.D. No. 1445; (2) refrain from issuing writs of execution or directing garnishment of government trust funds without ensuring compliance with COA procedures and applicable appropriations law; (3) heed Administrative Circular No. 10-2000 requiring utmost caution, prudence and judiciousness in issuing executions against government agencies and LGUs; (4) ensure that any award to be satisfied from public funds has proper statutory or appropriation authority; and (5) when making awards, provide clear and distinct findings of fact and law required by Section 14, Article VIII of the Constitution and Rule 36 of the Rules of Court, particularly when granting substantial damages or attorney’s fees. Failure to observe these principles renders any such execution orders void.</p>

## Conclude: what are the practical takeaways for a law student preparing for oral recitation on this case?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
For recitation, focus on three interlocking pillars: (1) the characterization of UP as a government instrumentality administering special trust funds; (2) PD No. 1445 and COA’s primary jurisdiction over auditing and settling claims against the government, which precludes immediate garnishment of government funds absent COA settlement or appropriation; and (3) the constitutional and procedural requirement that courts must state clear and distinct findings of fact and law to justify awards of actual and moral damages and attorney’s fees — failure to do so renders those awards void. Be prepared to explain the procedural chronology (dates of RTC decision, motions, service issues, writ of execution, garnishments, CA decisions, and the Supreme Court’s corrective measures), the reasons the RTC orders were void, the retroactive application of the Neypes fresh-period rule to remedy the appeal-timeliness problem, and the remedial command to redeposit wrongfully withdrawn funds. In oral recitation, articulate how fiscal safeguards, separation of powers, and due process interact in this case and why the Court prioritized statutory auditing and appropriation mechanisms over immediate judicial enforcement against government funds.</p>
