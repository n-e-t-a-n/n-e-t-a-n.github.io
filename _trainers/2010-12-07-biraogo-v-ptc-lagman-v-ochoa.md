## [1. What are the two consolidated cases about, in broad terms?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The two cases, Biraogo v. Aquino (G.R. No. 192935) and Lagman v. Aquino (G.R. No. 193036), challenge Executive Order No. 1 (EO No. 1) which created the Philippine Truth Commission of 2010. The petitions argue that EO No. 1 is unconstitutional because it purportedly (a) usurps Congress's power to create a public office and appropriate funds, (b) infringes the separation of powers by intruding on the Ombudsman and the DOJ, (c) violates equal protection by singling out the “previous administration” for investigation, and (d) seeks injunctive relief inappropriately. The Court’s decision ultimately declares EO No. 1 unconstitutional insofar as it violates the equal-protection clause, though it also discusses standing, jurisdiction, and the proper constitutional framework for executive-branch investigations. </p>
</details>

## [2. Who filed the petitions challenging EO No. 1, and in what capacities did they sue?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Two sets of petitioners filed the actions. In G.R. No. 192935, Louis C. Biraogo filed a special civil action for prohibition in his capacity as a citizen and taxpayer. In G.R. No. 193036, Edcel C. Lagman, Rodolfo B. Albano, Jr., Simeon A. Datumanong, and Orlando B. Fua, Sr., filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition as incumbent Members of the House of Representatives. The petitions attacked EO No. 1 as unconstitutional on multiple grounds, including separation of powers and equal protection.</p>
</details>

## [3. What is EO No. 1, and what did it create?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>EO No. 1, issued by President Benigno S. Aquino III on July 30, 2010, titled Creating the Philippine Truth Commission of 2010, created an ad hoc body described as an “independent collegial body” within the Office of the President. Its stated purpose was to seek and find the truth about reports of large-scale graft and corruption during the previous administration and to investigate, collect evidence, and thereafter submit findings and recommendations to the President, Congress, and the Ombudsman. It was empowered to compel information, hear witnesses, administer oaths, and refer evidence to prosecutorial authorities, among other powers, and to publish interim and final reports. It was envisioned to operate on a timeline ending December 31, 2012. The Commission’s funding was to come from the Office of the President, funded through existing appropriations. </p>
</details>

## [4. What were the principal issues the Court was asked to resolve?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The essential issues included: (1) whether petitioners have legal standing to challenge EO No. 1; (2) whether EO No. 1 violates the separation of powers by usurping Congress’s power to create public offices and appropriate funds; (3) whether EO No. 1 supplants the Ombudsman and the DOJ; (4) whether EO No. 1 violates the equal protection clause; and (5) whether petitioners are entitled to injunctive relief. The Court also considered the essential requisites for judicial review (case or controversy, standing, timely raise of the constitutional question, and lis mota). </p>
</details>

## [5. What is the Court’s general posture on judicial review in this case?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court frames judicial review as a constitutional duty to resolve actual controversies and to determine whether there has been grave abuse of discretion by a branch or instrumentality. It emphasizes that the judiciary must balance deference to the other branches with the obligation to uphold constitutional boundaries. The decision ultimately grants the petitions, declaring EO No. 1 unconstitutional insofar as it violates the equal-protection clause, while noting that the broader questions about executive power and the independence of the Ombudsman remain subject to further jurisprudence and possible revisions to EO No. 1.</p>
</details>

## [6. What is the Court’s position on standing for the petitioners?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court found the petitioners had standing. The petitioners-legislators asserted an institutional injury, arguing that EO No. 1 usurps Congress’ prerogatives, a kind of “derivative injury” to their office. Philippine Constitution Association v. Enriquez supports the idea that if Congress’ powers are impaired, a member has standing to challenge. Biraogo, as a taxpayer, also showed a personal stake. The Court’s stance was that the issues are of transcendental importance and public interest, justifying standing in these extraordinary public-law questions.</p>
</details>

## [7. How does the Court treat the “transcendental importance” doctrine in this case?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court acknowledges transcendental importance—where issues affect the Constitution or the fundamental structure of government—as a basis to relax standing requirements. It cites Coconut Oil Refiners Association and other cases to justify relaxing standing for issues of great public significance. In Biraogo, the Court found that the petition raises such issues—constitutional boundaries, separation of powers, and equal protection—thus supporting standing for review.</p>
</details>

## [8. What is the “power of the President to create a public office” as argued by petitioners, and how did the Court analyze it?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Petitioners argued that EO No. 1 creates a new public office—the Philippine Truth Commission—and that the President may not create a new public office under the 1987 Constitution, which vests legislative power to Congress for creating public offices. The Court, however, does not simply adopt a strict reading that the President cannot create any public office; rather, it evaluates whether the EO’s mechanism complies with the Constitution, statutory law (especially Section 31 of EO 292 and PD 1416, as amended), and the equal-protection guarantees. The Court ultimately holds that, while the President does have substantial powers to reorganize and to appoint ad hoc investigative bodies, EO No. 1 as drafted impermissibly discriminates against past administrations and thus violates equal protection. The decision engages in a nuanced discussion about the President’s faithful-execution duty (Section 17, Article VII) and the limits of Section 31 (reorganization) and PD 1416-era authorities, ultimately concluding the EO cannot stand on equal-protection grounds.</p>
</details>

## [9. How does the Court distinguish between “reorganizing” the Office of the President and creating a new public office?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court emphasizes that Section 31 of EO 292 permits continuing authority to reorganize the Office of the President—such action contemplates restructuring, transferring functions, or merging units within the Office of the President Proper. It does not explicitly authorize the creation of a new public office outside the preexisting structure. The majority reads EO No. 1 as creating a new public office, not merely reorganizing inside the President’s Office, and thus, under the Constitution, Congress—rather than the President—retains exclusive power to create public offices. This distinction becomes central to the equal-protection analysis because EO 1 singled out the prior administration for a unique investigatory mechanism, a distinction the Court deemed constitutionally suspect.</p>
</details>

## [10. What is the role of PD 1416 and PD 1772 in the Court’s analysis?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>PD 1416 (and its amendment PD 1772) originally delegated broad reorganizational authority to the President, including creation of offices and transfer of funds, during Marcos’ era, often tied to a transition toward a parliamentary system. The Court notes that these decrees are stale and inoperable post-1987 Constitution; the practice of relying on them to justify EO No. 1 is rejected. The majority also rejects the relevance of PD 1416 as a basis for creating a new public office, since the Constitution places the statutory power to create offices in Congress, not the President, and PD 1416’s framework is inconsistent with the post-1987 constitutional order. A dissenting view, however, critiques this position and argues that the President’s residual powers could justify a flexible interpretation, though that view is not the controlling one in the majority’s analysis here.</p>
</details>

## [11. What is the Ombudsman’s constitutional role in graft investigations, and how does EO No. 1 relate to it?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Ombudsman has primary jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute acts of graft and corruption under Article XI of the 1987 Constitution (RA 6770 implements this). The majority emphasizes that EO No. 1 does not purport to nullify or replace the Ombudsman; instead, it contends that the Truth Commission’s findings would be advisory/recommendatory and complement the Ombudsman and DOJ. However, the petitioners argued that EO No. 1 usurps Ombudsman functions because the President would elevate a parallel body into a quasi-judicial role. The Court ultimately found EO No. 1 unconstitutional on equal-protection grounds for creating a separate class (the previous administration) for investigation, which could undermine the Ombudsman’s primacy and public trust, but it left open the question of how to harmonize the Commission’s investigative role with the Ombudsman’s powers if properly framed.</p>
</details>

## [12. What does the Court say about the Truth Commission’s “truth-telling” function and due process?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The majority recognizes EO 1’s “truth-telling” function as a distinguishing feature in the Philippine context but cautions that the public dissemination of “truth” before formal adjudication raises due-process concerns. The separate opinions in the case emphasize more pointed due-process risks—e.g., prejudicial effects on accused officials, potential priming of public opinion, and the possibility that Truth Commission findings could unduly influence prosecutors, courts, and public perception. The ponencia notes that the Commission’s findings are not binding and that the Ombudsman and Sandiganbayan retain prosecutorial and judicial authority, but the overall tone of the Separate Opinions highlights substantial due-process risks from a state-sponsored “truth” narrative ahead of adjudication.</p>
</details>

## [13. How does the majority treat the equal-protection challenge?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The majority holds that EO No. 1 violates the equal-protection clause because its scope and target—“the previous administration” as the initial subject of investigation—are not sufficiently distinguished to justify such a special remedial device. It reasons that (1) there is no substantial or germane distinction between the Arroyo administration and earlier administrations, (2) the purpose stated for EO No. 1 is not germane to that classification, (3) EO 1 does not contemplate future conditions in a way that would render the classification reasonable, and (4) the provision on mandating potential future expansion does not cure the present arbitrariness. The Court thus strikes EO No. 1 insofar as it contravenes equal protection, though it leaves open the possibility that a revised EO could survive if framed to avoid arbitrary selectivity and to include broader, non-arbitrary scope.</p>
</details>

## [14. What four criteria does the Court identify for a valid equal-protection classification?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court adopts the standard that a valid classification must satisfy four requisites: (1) rests on substantial distinctions; (2) is germane to the law’s purpose; (3) not limited to existing conditions only; and (4) applies equally to all members of the same class. The majority applies these tests to EO No. 1 and finds the classification of the Arroyo administration as the initial subject of investigation lacking a valid, substantial basis and not germane to the stated objective of stamping out graft and corruption. The Court also discusses the concept that underinclusiveness is not automatically fatal to a law, but in this case the deliberate focus on a single administration coupled with future-expansion language did not satisfy the requisite reasonableness.</p>
</details>

## [15. How does the dissent (Justice Corona) view the equal-protection issue?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Justice Corona’s separate opinions argue that EO No. 1’s equal-protection challenge is not properly sustained by the majority’s reasoning. He contends that EO 1 is a permissible extension of executive power, including the President’s power to investigate and to create ad hoc bodies to aid in faithful execution of the laws. He cites the President’s control powers, the faithful-execution clause, and precedents recognizing ad hoc investigative committees. He asserts that EO No. 1’s targeting of the Arroyo administration is not unconstitutional discrimination because it can be rationally tied to the government’s urgent interest in addressing ongoing graft concerns and public accountability, given the time-sensitive context and the need for practical, fiscally feasible action. He also points to distinctions recognized in prior PCGG-like commissions that involved past administrations. In short, he believes the equal-protection claim fails under a rational-basis analysis or is not properly before the Court as a constitutional violation.</p>
</details>

## [16. How do the other dissenters (Brion, Perez, Nachura, Bersamin) differ in their views?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Several separate opinions criticize the majority’s handling of the issue. Justice Brion’s separate opinion emphasizes due process and the risks that “truth-telling” and public priming pose to fair trials and the integrity of the judiciary and Ombudsman; he argues that the Truth Commission’s independence and the openness of its proceedings could subvert the criminal-justice process. Justice Perez similarly questions whether EO 1 properly respects the constitutional division of powers and argues that the Commission’s quasi-judicial features are not clearly limited. Justice Nachura emphasizes that the Court should give weight to executive prerogatives in the faithful execution of laws and defends the President’s power to create ad hoc investigative bodies in appropriate cases; he also suggests that EO No. 1, if properly framed, could survive constitutional scrutiny. Associate Justice Bersamin joins the majority on the constitutional questions but acknowledges the substantial policy considerations and stresses that the Court should be cautious about resolving issues that may undermine executive prerogatives or future corrective actions.</p>
</details>

## [17. What is the Court’s ruling on the “public-office” creation issue?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The majority does not declare that EO No. 1 can be sustained as a matter of pure executive power; rather, it grants the petitions on equal-protection grounds. It recognizes the President’s power to create ad hoc investigative bodies but finds EO No. 1 unconstitutional insofar as it singles out the “previous administration” in a way that violates equal protection. The decision thus rejects EO No. 1 as written, while leaving room for a differently framed order that might still achieve legitimate objectives without constitutional infirmities.</p>
</details>

## [18. How does the Court treat the notion that EO No. 1 is “an ad hoc and independent truth commission”?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court discusses the idea that truth commissions are typically ad hoc, independent bodies in transitional contexts. However, it emphasizes that the Philippine setting after 1987 does not mirror the post-conflict, transitional types of truth commissions abroad. The majority found that EO No. 1’s framing, its supposed independence, and especially its targeted equal-protection flaw make the measure unconstitutional as framed. The Separate Opinions emphasize that truth commissions can be legitimate and useful, but only if constructed within constitutional parameters that respect separation of powers and due process.</p>
</details>

## [19. What does the Court say about the Truth Commission’s quasi-judicial powers?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The majority notes that EO No. 1 does not vest the Truth Commission with quasi-judicial powers; its function is investigative and advisory, with findings and recommendations not binding on the Ombudsman or DOJ. The text of EO No. 1 contemplates that the Commission can gather and evaluate evidence and forward interim reports to prosecutorial authorities. Still, the concerns arise because the Commission’s authority to assess “reasonable grounds” and to weigh evidence could encroach on prosecutorial discretion if framed improperly. The dissenters argue that the Commission does possess quasi-judicial-like discretion in evaluating evidence to determine probable cause for prosecution, which would be unconstitutional without legislative delegation.</p>
</details>

## [20. What is the “special provision concerning mandate” (Section 17) in EO No. 1, and why is it significant?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Section 17 provides that if the President determines a need to expand the Truth Commission’s mandate to include investigations of graft and corruption during prior administrations, such expansion may be accomplished by a supplemental Executive Order. The majority finds this problematic because, while it contemplates future expansion, it does not guarantee that future administrations will extend the mandate, and the present EO’s focus remains on the Arroyo administration, which the majority views as a targeted classification. This conditional expansion provision illustrates the political and constitutional fragility of EO No. 1’s framework, and the Court used it as part of its equal-protection analysis—arguing that the ability to expand by whim undermines predictability and constitutional safeguards.</p>
</details>

## [21. How does the Court treat the timing and duration of the Truth Commission’s mandate?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The EO set a finite duration (accomplish its mission by December 31, 2012). The majority’s equal-protection analysis does not hinge on the temporal limitation per se, but rather on whether the targeted scope and the classification of “previous administration” are constitutionally permissible. The dissenters argue that time-bound commissions are common and legitimate, but the majority emphasizes that the combination of a limited scope with an explicit future-expansion mechanism can render the classification arbitrary and therefore unconstitutional.</p>
</details>

## [22. What is the importance of the “budget for the Commission” provision in EO No. 1?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>EO No. 1 provides that the Office of the President shall provide the necessary funds for the Commission. The majority accepts that funding through the President’s budget is permissible so long as it does not amount to a new appropriation by statute. However, because the EO creates a distinct public office with independent identity rather than reorganizing an existing unit, the budgetary structure contributes to the perception that a new public office is being created—an issue central to the separation-of-powers and equal-protection analyses. The Court’s equal-protection ruling thus indirectly implicates how funding is allocated to new bodies created by executive order.</p>
</details>

## [23. How do the majority and dissenting opinions view the impact of the Truth Commission on public memory and the “priming” of the public?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The majority expresses concern that a government-sponsored “truth-telling” body could prime the public to accept its conclusions as truth, which could prejudice ongoing or future prosecutions and affect the integrity of the Ombudsman and judiciary. The dissenting opinions, however, emphasize that truth commissions can help build accountability and collective memory; they argue the public has a right to know and that the judiciary should not suppress legitimate truth-seeking. The Separate Opinions warn about the risks of political influence on the judiciary and the need to safeguard due process while pursuing truth.</p>
</details>

## [24. What is the standard for “equal protection of the laws” in this Philippine case, and how is it applied?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court applies the general “equal protection” standard: classifications must rest on substantial distinctions, be germane to the statute’s purpose, not be limited to existing conditions only, and apply equally to all members of the class. The majority found EO No. 1 failed this test because the targeted class—the Arroyo administration—lacked substantial, germane distinctions that would justify separate treatment, especially given that corruption was a systemic concern across administrations and that prior administrations had faced investigations by other bodies. The Court thus found EO No. 1 unconstitutional under equal protection.</p>
</details>

## [25. What is the “public-office” versus “ad hoc fact-finding committee” distinction in the opinions?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The majority treats EO No. 1 as creating a “public office” (the Truth Commission) with a semi-permanent identity, funded through the Office of the President, with an authorized rules framework and a timeline. The dissenters argue that even if the Truth Commission is an ad hoc fact-finding body, its creation through EO No. 1 (and its “truth-telling” mandate) still raises serious constitutional concerns about independence, separation of powers, and potential quasi-judicial effects. The core is whether the Commission can exist within the executive branch in a neutral, noncoercive form, or whether it constitutes a political instrument outside the Constitution’s structural framework.</p>
</details>

## [26. How does the Court treat Section 31’s “continuing authority to reorganize” in relation to EO No. 1?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court emphasizes that Section 31 grants the President continuing authority to reorganize the Office of the President to achieve economy and efficiency, including transferring functions or abolishing/merging units within the Office of the President Proper. It does not expressly authorize the creation of a brand-new public office outside the existing structure. Consequently, while the President has reorganization powers, the creation of a new public office—like the Truth Commission—requires constitutional or statutory authorization beyond what EO No. 1 provides. This forms part of the equal-protection analysis in the majority’s decision.</p>
</details>

## [27. How does the majority address the argument that EO No. 1’s funding is only an allocation of existing funds?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The majority notes that although the funds were to come from funds already appropriated to the Office of the President, EO No. 1’s creation of a separate public office raises questions about whether it constitutes a “new” public office that would require new appropriation by law. Since the Constitution vests the power of the purse in Congress, funding a new public office via an executive order can raise constitutional concerns if it bypasses legislative appropriation. The Court held that EO No. 1, as drafted, involves a constitutional problem under equal protection and separation-of-powers, not simply a budgetary technicality.</p>
</details>

## [28. Why does the Court say EO No. 1 is unconstitutional “insofar as” it violates equal protection?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court concluded that EO No. 1’s temporal and targeted classification—the initial focus on the Arroyo administration as the sole subject of the Truth Commission—lacked substantial distinctions, was not germane to the Commission’s stated objective, and could not be justified as a necessary step in addressing graft. Even though EO 1 contains a provision allowing expansion (Section 17), the present framing is unconstitutional for violating equal protection because it singles out a single administration, creating a precedent that discriminates against a group of public officers based solely on time, rather than on a legitimate, demonstrable difference. The decision thus voids EO No. 1’s equal-protection basis, while leaving room for other lawful approaches in future actions.</p>
</details>

## [29. What do the separate opinions say about “due process” and the “priming” risk?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Justice Brion’s Separate Concurring Opinion focuses on due process concerns: the “truth-telling” function, the public priming of conclusions, and the potential prejudice against those investigated, as well as potential influence on the Ombudsman and courts. He warns that the public’s reception of the Commission’s findings as “truth” could distort subsequent proceedings and undermine the fairness of trials. He argues for ensuring due process and independence, cautioning that truth-telling should not override constitutional safeguards. The other dissenters echo similar concerns about the risk of political manipulation and the need to preserve the integrity of the criminal-justice process.</p>
</details>

## [30. How does the majority frame the historical role of truth commissions in other countries?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The majority acknowledges that truth commissions in other countries have been used in transitional settings to establish accountability and promote reconciliation. However, it emphasizes that the Philippine context post-1987 is different: there is a functioning constitutional framework, including an independent Ombudsman, and the Truth Commission must be reconciled with the Constitution and existing laws. The Court suggests that the distinct Philippine legal framework requires a differently structured approach to truth-seeking, one that fits within constitutional boundaries rather than importing foreign models wholesale.</p>
</details>

## [31. What does the Court say about the potential impact on the Ombudsman and the Sandiganbayan if EO No. 1 had been allowed to operate as written?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court expresses concern that the Truth Commission’s “truth-telling” function—if publicly disseminated and given interpretive weight—could undermine the Ombudsman’s independence and the Sandiganbayan’s role by injecting a quasi-judicial, outcome-oriented narrative into the criminal justice process before the proper investigations and prosecutions occur. It warned that such a scheme could erode the constitutional division of labor and exert political pressure on the prosecution and judiciary, even if the Commission’s determinations are non-binding. The dissenting opinions elaborate on these risks in greater detail.</p>
</details>

## [32. What is the Court’s final disposition in the decision?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court grants the petitions and declares EO No. 1 unconstitutional insofar as it violates the equal-protection clause of the 1987 Constitution. It orders respondents to cease carrying out EO No. 1’s provisions to the extent they infringe equal protection. The decision, however, leaves room for reconsideration or redrafting of EO No. 1 (or a similar instrument) that would address the constitutional concerns raised, particularly with respect to a non-arbitrary scope and appropriate legislative authorization. The separate opinions emphasize additional grounds—separation of powers, due process, and independence of the Ombudsman—adding to the ongoing jurisprudential dialogue on the right framework for truth-seeking in governance.</p>
</details>

## [33. How did the majority view Section 17’s expansion provision (the possibility of expanding to include prior administrations) in light of equal protection?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The majority treated Section 17’s expansion provision as a potential mechanism to broaden the mandate but found that, standing alone, it could not cure the present equal-protection defect. The concern is that expansion by whim could permit an arbitrary, partisan targeting, undermining equal protection. In other words, even though expansion is contemplated, the current framings and control structure—if kept as-is—do not satisfy constitutional requirements; any expansion must be framed in a non-arbitrary, comprehensive, and legislatively authorized manner.</p>
</details>

## [34. What is the Court’s view on the possibility of amending EO No. 1 to include earlier administrations?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The majority suggests that a revision of the executive issuance to include earlier past administrations might pass the test of reasonableness if framed in a constitutionally sound way. The Justices in dissent, and some in the majority, discuss that equal protection requires a rational basis for classifications and that including all past administrations (without arbitrary exclusions) could be a permissible approach if anchored in substantial distinctions and consistent with constitutional text. The Court does not foreclose the possibility of a properly restructured truth commission but requires careful construction to align with constitutional mandates.</p>
</details>

## [35. What lasting lesson does the decision offer to future administrations contemplating truth commissions or similar bodies?]

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The decision highlights the primacy of constitutional constraints on executive action, even in pursuing laudable goals like anti-corruption. It underscores that truth commissions must be designed within the triple boundaries of (1) the Constitution’s separation of powers, (2) the independence and primacy of the Ombudsman and the judiciary in criminal matters, and (3) the equal-protection guarantees. It warns against creating ad hoc bodies that operate as “parallel” powers with nontransparent funding, undefined scope, or a discriminatory target. The Court’s stance invites carefully tailored, legislatively approved mechanisms that enable truth-seeking without eroding constitutional architecture.</p>
