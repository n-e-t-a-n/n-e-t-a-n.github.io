## State the procedural posture of this case: who appealed, from what decisions, and what relief was sought.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The case is a criminal appeal to the Supreme Court by accused-appellant Ybo Lastimosa, who sought reversal and setting aside of the February 11, 2022 Decision of the Court of Appeals (CA), Cebu City in CA-G.R. CR No. 03604. The CA had denied Lastimosa’s appeal from the June 1, 2018 Judgment of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 12, Cebu City (Criminal Case No. CBU-98906). The RTC originally convicted Lastimosa of Homicide; the CA reversed that and convicted him of Murder. On appeal to the Supreme Court, Lastimosa challenged the denial of his appeal by the CA, raising essentially that the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt (asserting lack of proof of corpus delicti and unreliable witnesses). He also challenged the CA’s appreciation of the qualifying circumstance of treachery. The Supreme Court took up the appeal to review both factual and legal issues, and to resolve among others the admissibility and probative value of a photocopy of the death certificate presented during trial.</p>

## Summarize the factual background as presented by the prosecution.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The prosecution’s evidence centered on eyewitness testimony from Elmer Ca�eda and Vicente Cortes, and the testimony of the victim’s wife, Dureza Vega. They testified that on November 17, 2012 at around 4:30 p.m. in Sugarland, Cansojong, Talisay City, the victim, Ildefonso Vega Jr. (Ildefonso), was riding a motorcycle near a cockpit. Ca�eda said he was two to three meters away when he saw Lastimosa shoot Ildefonso three times, hitting him on the right jaw, causing Ildefonso and his motorcycle to fall. After the shooting Lastimosa rode a motorcycle with another person; the bike did not start immediately and Lastimosa’s helmet fell. Ca�eda helped bring Ildefonso to the hospital. Cortes corroborated that he saw Lastimosa shoot Ildefonso from about six meters away. Dureza testified she was informed her husband had been shot, followed to the hospital and found him dead; she also mentioned an autopsy and that she possessed a death certificate. The prosecution likewise presented a photocopy of the death certificate during Dureza’s testimony showing cause of death as gunshot wounds to the head and neck on November 17, 2012.</p>
</details>

## Summarize the defense’s factual account and the alibi presented.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The defense relied primarily on the testimony of accused-appellant Ybo Lastimosa and his live-in partner Maria Amie Paquit (also referred to in the record as Mary Ann Bargamento). Lastimosa denied being at the crime scene on November 17, 2012, asserting that at around 4:30 p.m. he was at his rented residence in Barangay San Roque, Cebu City, with his live-in partner and therefore could not have been in Cansojong, Talisay City. He claimed he had not met the deceased since his release from jail in 2012 and that the only shooting he had been involved in earlier had been settled by his brother. He also asserted he did not know the prosecution witnesses Ca�eda and Cortes prior to their courtroom appearances. Paquit testified to corroborate his alibi. The defense therefore offered denial and alibi as its principal defenses.</p>
</details>

## What charges were originally filed in the Information and what specific circumstances were alleged?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Information, dated February 12, 2013, charged Lastimosa with the crime of Murder. It alleged that on or about November 17, 2012 at around 4:30 p.m. in Cansojong, Talisay City, the accused, "armed with a firearm of unknown caliber, with deliberate intent, with intent to kill, and with treachery and evident premeditation," attacked and shot Ildefonso Vega, Jr., inflicting fatal gunshot wounds, causing his instantaneous death. Thus the Information alleged the use of a firearm and the qualifying circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation, although it did so in general terms without specifying the ultimate facts that would constitute those qualifying circumstances.</p>
</details>

## How did the RTC rule on the guilt of the accused and what punishments and damages did it impose?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The RTC, in its June 1, 2018 Judgment, found Ybo Lastimosa guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Homicide (not Murder). It imposed an indeterminate sentence consisting of prision mayor medium as the minimum (8 years and 1 day) and reclusion temporal medium as the maximum (14 years, 8 months and 1 day). The RTC awarded the heirs of Ildefonso PHP 75,000.00 as civil indemnity, PHP 50,000.00 as moral damages, PHP 25,000.00 as temperate damages, and PHP 25,000.00 as exemplary damages, all without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and ordered interest at 6% per annum from finality until fully paid. The RTC credited the accused with his preventive imprisonment as a detention prisoner. The RTC did not find treachery or evident premeditation proved.</p>
</details>

## What did the Court of Appeals decide on appeal from the RTC, and how did its judgment differ?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court of Appeals (CA), in its February 11, 2022 Decision, denied Lastimosa’s appeal but modified the RTC’s conviction from Homicide to Murder. The CA found that the prosecution proved the elements of Murder beyond reasonable doubt, rejecting the defense claims regarding corpus delicti and witness credibility, and concluding that treachery attended the killing. The CA therefore imposed reclusion perpetua and increased the damages awarded: civil indemnity PHP 75,000; moral damages PHP 75,000; exemplary damages PHP 75,000; and temperate damages PHP 50,000, plus 6% interest. The CA thus elevated the degree of the crime by recognizing the qualifying circumstance of treachery, which the RTC had not found present.</p>
</details>

## Identify the main issues the Supreme Court framed for resolution in this appeal.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Supreme Court framed two primary issues: (I) whether the Court-a quo gravely erred in convicting Lastimosa despite the alleged failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt, specifically contending improper proof of corpus delicti and the unreliability of prosecution witnesses; and (II) whether the Court of Appeals erred in convicting the accused of Murder despite the alleged failure to prove the qualifying circumstance of treachery.</p>
</details>

## How did the Supreme Court treat the scope of appellate review in this criminal appeal?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Supreme Court reiterated that in criminal cases an appeal opens the entire case for review and that the reviewing tribunal can correct errors, even those unassigned in the appealed judgment. The appellate court has full jurisdiction to examine records, revise the judgment, increase the penalty, and cite the correct provision of the penal law. Accordingly, the Supreme Court treated its authority as encompassing examination of both factual findings (subject to deference) and legal issues, including the sufficiency of evidence and the proper appreciation of qualifying circumstances.</p>
</details>

## Explain the Supreme Court’s analysis on whether the corpus delicti of the crime was proven.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Supreme Court held that the corpus delicti was sufficiently proven. It found that the testimony of the victim’s wife, Dureza, who testified that when she arrived at the hospital she found her husband already dead and that he was shot, adequately established the fact of death. The Court emphasized that neither the autopsy report nor the testimony of the medico-legal officer is an essential prerequisite to proving murder. In addition, the duplicate (photocopy) of the death certificate corroborated Dureza’s testimony by showing the date of death (November 17, 2012) and cause of death (gunshot wounds to the head and neck). Together, the testimonial and documentary evidence satisfied the requirement to establish the corpus delicti.</p>
</details>

## What procedural or evidentiary problem related to the death certificate did the defense raise?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The defense contended that the prosecution presented only a photocopy (machine copy) of the death certificate and did not produce the original. It argued that the photocopy had not been authenticated and was therefore inadmissible and of no probative value. Relying on the absence of the original autopsy report or the medico-legal officer’s testimony, the defense argued that there was no proof that the victim’s death was caused by the gunshot wounds attributed to the accused, thereby asserting that the corpus delicti was not established.</p>
</details>

## Explain the Supreme Court’s exposition of the Best Evidence Rule and its evolution in this decision.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Supreme Court provided a historical development of what has been traditionally called the Best Evidence Rule, tracing its iterations from Act No. 190 (1901), through the 1940 Rules, the 1964 and 1989 Rules, to the 1997 Rules of Court, and finally to the 2019 Revised Rules on Evidence and the 2001 Rules on Electronic Evidence. It explained that older formulations generally required production of the original document when the contents were in issue, admitting secondary evidence only in specified exceptions. The Court highlighted that the 2001 Rules on Electronic Evidence treated certain electronic duplicates as equivalents of the original. With the 2019 Revised Rules on Evidence, the 2019 Rule 130, Sections 3 and 4(c) expressly defined a "duplicate" and provided that a duplicate is admissible to the same extent as an original unless authenticity of the original is genuinely questioned or admission of the duplicate would be unjust or inequitable. The Court thereby showed that the Best Evidence Rule has been materially modified by the 2019 rules to broaden admissibility of duplicates, including photocopies, subject to safeguards.</p>
</details>

## How did the Court reconcile its earlier decision in MCC Industrial Sales Corporation v. Ssangyong with the 2019 Revised Rules?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>In MCC Industrial, the Court had held that facsimile transmissions are paper-based and not electronic documents under the Electronic Commerce Act; therefore, copies of facsimile transmissions were not admissible as electronic evidence. That ruling created a dichotomy between electronic data/messages and paper-based documents. However, the Supreme Court in this case concluded that the dichotomy established in MCC Industrial was effectively abandoned by the 2019 Revised Rules on Evidence. Rule 130 Section 4(c) of the 2019 Rules broadly defines "duplicate" and makes duplicates admissible to the same extent as originals unless authenticity is genuinely questioned or admission would be unjust. The Court held that this definition and rule apply to duplicates of electronic and paper-based originals alike. Consequently, MCC Industrial’s restrictive dichotomy no longer controls.</p>
</details>

## Did the Court find the photocopy of the death certificate admissible? Explain the legal basis.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Yes. The Supreme Court found the photocopy of the death certificate admissible under Rule 130, Section 4(c) of the 2019 Revised Rules on Evidence, which states that a duplicate is admissible to the same extent as an original unless (1) a genuine question is raised as to the authenticity of the original, or (2) under the circumstances it is unjust or inequitable to admit the duplicate in lieu of the original. The Court reasoned that a photocopy is a duplicate within the rule’s definition (a counterpart produced by the same impression or by photographic or mechanical reproduction). Because no genuine question was raised regarding the authenticity of the original death certificate and there was no showing that admitting the photocopy would be unjust or inequitable, the machine copy (Exhibit "B") was admissible. The Court also noted that the 2019 Rules could be applied retroactively to pending cases where procedural changes do not impair vested rights, and determined retroactive application was appropriate here.</p>
</details>

## How did the Court address retroactivity concerns regarding application of the 2019 Rules to a photocopy admitted in 2014?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court acknowledged that the photocopy was marked in 2014 and that the 2019 Revised Rules on Evidence took effect on May 1, 2020. It explained the general principle that procedural rules may be given retroactive effect if they are procedural and do not create new or take away vested rights. Citing precedent (Tan, Jr. v. Court of Appeals and Ruben Agpalo’s principles), the Court found that applying Rule 130 Section 4(c) retroactively in this case would not work injustice or impair vested rights. The admission of the duplicate did not create the conviction; the testimonial evidence independently established corpus delicti. Therefore, retroactive application was permissible and did not cause unfairness.</p>
</details>

## Distinguish admissibility from probative value as discussed by the Court.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court stressed that admissibility is a preliminary question of whether evidence can be considered at all, governed by relevance and competence under the rules of evidence. Probative value, on the other hand, pertains to the weight or persuasive effect the evidence has in proving an issue once admitted. The Court emphasized that a piece of evidence may be admissible yet have little probative value, and vice versa. In this case, the photocopy of the death certificate was admissible as a duplicate; its probative value lay in corroborating Dureza’s testimony regarding the date and cause of death. Thus admissibility did not automatically determine the strength of the evidence; the court must evaluate weight in the context of all evidence.</p>
</details>

## How did the Court assess the eyewitness identifications of the accused by Ca�eda and Cortes?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court accepted the positive eyewitness identifications by Ca�eda and Cortes. Ca�eda testified he was two to three meters away and saw Lastimosa shoot Ildefonso three times, specifying the right side of the jaw as the point of impact, and identifying Lastimosa in court. Cortes testified he was about six meters away and also identified Lastimosa. The Court found both testimonies straightforward and convincing. It observed that the trial court’s factual findings and credibility assessments are entitled to great respect unless substantial reasons exist to overturn them. The defense’s attempts to impeach witness motives or belatedness of appearance did not sufficiently undermine the credibility of their positive, detailed identifications. The Court also noted that denial and alibi are weak defenses that cannot outweigh positive eyewitness testimony absent strict proof that it was physically impossible for the accused to be at the locus delicti; here the accused failed to show such impossibility and his alibi was insufficient to displace the eyewitness accounts.</p>
</details>

## What standard did the Court apply to the defendant’s alibi defense, and why did it fail?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court applied the established principle that for an alibi to prevail, the accused must prove that he was at some other place at the time of the crime and that it was physically impossible for him to be at the locus delicti or within its immediate vicinity. These requirements of time and place must be strictly met. In this case, Lastimosa’s alibi was supported only by his live-in partner’s testimony that he was at his rented residence in Barangay San Roque at the relevant time. The Court found that Lastimosa did not demonstrate physical impossibility: travel between his residence in Cebu City and the crime scene in Talisay City would take about an hour, so it was not impossible for him to be at the scene. Against the positive and contemporaneous eyewitness identifications, his alibi lacked the strict proof necessary to prevail.</p>
</details>

## Define treachery as a qualifying circumstance and list its elements as used by the Court.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Treachery, as a qualifying circumstance under Article 248, was defined by the Court as occurring "when the offender commits any of the crimes against the person, employing means, methods, or forms in the execution thereof, which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make." The two elements that must be shown are: (1) at the time of the attack, the victim was not in a position to defend himself or herself; and (2) the offender consciously adopted the particular means, methods, or form of attack employed. Both elements must be present for treachery to be appreciated.</p>
</details>

## Did the Supreme Court find treachery present in this case? Explain the Court’s reasoning.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Yes. The Supreme Court agreed with the CA that treachery attended the killing. It found both elements of treachery present. First, the testimony established that the victim was on his motorcycle standing still near the cockpit and there was no showing of an antecedent altercation that would have placed him on notice or in a position to defend himself when he was shot; thus he was unable to defend or retaliate. Second, the accused consciously adopted a method to ensure execution—he used a firearm and aimed for vital parts (head/neck), shooting three times. The Court analogized to prior cases where aiming at vital parts indicated deliberate aim to ensure the crime's execution. The location of the wounds and the multiplicity of shots supported the inference that the attacker sought to guarantee the fatal outcome, satisfying treachery’s requirements.</p>
</details>

## Why did the Court reject evident premeditation as an attendant circumstance in this case?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court rejected evident premeditation because the prosecution failed to prove the requisites: (1) when the accused determined to commit the crime, (2) any act indicating he clung to that determination, and (3) a sufficient lapse of time between the determination and execution to allow reflection. The essence of evident premeditation is cool reflection and a sustained resolve prior to execution; the record contained no evidence showing the accused had reflected over time and maintained a deliberate plan to kill. The shooting, as recounted, was sudden and unexpected, and there was no proof of prior planning or of acts demonstrating a persistent resolve to act. Therefore evident premeditation could not be appreciated.</p>
</details>

## What was the Supreme Court’s disposition on the conviction and sentence?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision convicting Lastimosa of Murder. It sentenced him to reclusion perpetua (the lesser of the two possible penalties for Murder, reclusion perpetua to death, applying the lower due to absence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances) and ordered him to pay damages: civil indemnity PHP 75,000; moral damages PHP 75,000; exemplary damages PHP 75,000; and temperate damages PHP 50,000, with legal interest at 6% per annum from finality until fully paid. The Court also noted that under RA No. 9346, the convict is not eligible for parole under the Indeterminate Sentence Law.</p>
</details>

## How did the Court treat the procedural defect noted in Solar concerning alleging qualifying circumstances in the Information?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court observed that the Information had alleged treachery and evident premeditation in general terms without stating the ultimate facts constituting those circumstances, which Solar (People v. Solar) held insufficient. Solar requires prosecutors to state ultimate facts relative to qualifying/aggravating circumstances or attach the resolution finding probable cause that contains such particulars; otherwise the accused may move to quash or seek a bill of particulars. However, because the RTC judgment was pending appeal when Solar was promulgated, the Court applied Solar’s fifth guideline. It found that Lastimosa did not file a motion to quash or for a bill of particulars to challenge the generic allegations, and thus, under Solar, he waived his right to assail the defective statement. Therefore, the qualifying circumstances could be appreciated against him at trial and on appeal.</p>
</details>

## If the accused had filed a motion to quash or bill of particulars challenging the vague allegations of treachery and premeditation, how would Solar require the courts to treat the Information?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Under Solar, if an accused timely files a motion to quash for failure to conform substantially to the prescribed form (Section 3(e), Rule 117), or seeks a bill of particulars to compel the prosecution to state the ultimate facts supporting the qualifying circumstances, the court must require the prosecution to state such ultimate facts or else the court may quash the Information or order amendment. Solar mandates that the prosecution should attach the resolution finding probable cause that explicitly sets forth the factual basis for such circumstances, and the accused should receive that resolution prior to arraignment. If the accused avails of those remedies, he preserves the right to contest the sufficiency of the allegations; failure to do so amounts to waiver. Thus, their timely filing would have forced the prosecution to particularize the factual statements underlying treachery and premeditation, or otherwise risk the disallowance of appreciation of those circumstances.</p>
</details>

## What role did the death certificate (photocopy) play in the Court’s overall assessment of evidence?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The photocopy of the death certificate served as corroborative documentary evidence of the victim’s death and its stated cause—gunshot wounds to the head and neck on November 17, 2012. While the Court acknowledged that the testimony of the victim’s wife, Dureza, alone was sufficient to establish the corpus delicti, the duplicate death certificate buttressed and corroborated her account. The Court emphasized the distinction between admissibility and probative value: the photocopy was admissible as a duplicate, and its probative weight rested on its corroborative function alongside the witnesses’ testimony. The duplicate was not the sole basis for conviction but reinforced the testimonial evidence.</p>
</details>

## How did the Court deal with the defense’s attack on the credibility of witnesses who testified belatedly or whose accounts lacked details?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court gave deference to the trial court’s credibility determinations, noting that such evaluations are entitled to great respect unless the appellate court finds that weighty circumstances were overlooked, misapprehended, or misapplied. It found Ca�eda’s and Cortes’s testimonies straightforward, consistent and sufficiently detailed regarding the shooting and the identification of the accused. The defense argument that the witnesses surfaced belatedly, lacked essential particulars, or failed to describe the firearm did not convince the Court to overturn the credibility findings. The Court observed that attempts by the defense to impeach witnesses by suggesting motives (debt of gratitude or urging by the victim’s wife) were denied by the witnesses and were unsupported by proof. Given the positive, direct eyewitness identification and corroboration, the Court found the witnesses credible and their testimony persuasive.</p>
</details>

## What precedent did the Court cite regarding the relative weakness of denial as a defense?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court cited the principle that denial is usually an inherently weak defense which cannot outweigh positive testimony. It stated that a categorical, credible positive identification tends to prevail over a bare denial because a denial can be fabricated and lacks the indicia of reliability. The Court reiterated that for an alibi to prevail, the accused must demonstrate physical impossibility of presence at the scene, and that Lastimosa’s denial and alibi, supported only by his partner’s testimony, failed to meet this strict standard in the face of two positive eyewitness identifications.</p>
</details>

## Explain why the firearm’s licensing or lack thereof was not considered in the final judgment.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Although the Information alleged that the accused was "armed with a firearm of unknown caliber," it did not allege that the firearm was unlicensed, nor did the prosecution present evidence regarding the weapon’s registration or licensing status. The Court noted that the Information failed to allege the firearm was unlicensed and that no evidence of such character was introduced at trial. Therefore, the licensing status of the firearm was not material to the elements of the crime as charged and was not considered in determining guilt or attendant circumstances. The focus remained on the killing itself and the qualifying circumstance of treachery proven by manner and context of the shooting.</p>
</details>

## Discuss the Court’s view on the interplay between the Rules on Electronic Evidence and the 2019 Revised Rules on Evidence.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court explained that the Rules on Electronic Evidence (2001) recognized certain printed outputs or duplicates of electronic documents as originals for purposes of the Best Evidence Rule. Initially, in MCC Industrial the Court limited the application of Rule 4 of the Rules on Electronic Evidence to electronic messages and documents and refused to treat facsimile (a paper-based transmission) as an electronic document. However, after the 2019 Revised Rules on Evidence took effect, the Court observed that Rule 130’s modern definition of "duplicate" and its provisions aligning duplicates with originals removed the strict dichotomy between electronic and paper-based originals. Thus the 2019 Rules, when read in conjunction with the Rules on Electronic Evidence, extend admissibility to duplicates of all kinds—electronic and paper-based—unless authenticity is genuinely challenged or admission would be inequitable. In short, the Court saw the Rules as complementary and the 2019 Rules as broadening the scope of admissibility for duplicates.</p>
</details>

## What is the significance of the Court’s treatment of duplication and admissibility for future cases?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court’s treatment signals an important shift: duplicates, including photocopies of paper-based originals, may now be admitted to the same extent as originals provided no genuine question of authenticity is raised and admission would not be unjust. This simplifies evidentiary practice and reflects practical realities where originals may not always be available. It reduces the rigid application of the old best evidence doctrine and places emphasis on the integrity of documents and the presence of reasons to require originals. However, the Court also preserved safeguards: authenticity and fairness remain grounds to require originals. This approach should streamline trials and reduce technical objections over absence of originals, while maintaining protections against forgery or unfair prejudice.</p>
</details>

## How did the Court reconcile admitting a photocopy with protecting the accused’s rights and ensuring fairness of trial?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court balanced admissibility with fairness by applying the two exceptions in Rule 130 Section 4(c): a duplicate is admissible unless there is a genuine question as to the original’s authenticity or unless admitting the duplicate would be unjust or inequitable. In this case, neither exception was present—no party questioned the authenticity of the death certificate’s original, and admitting the duplicate did not prejudice the accused because testimonial evidence independently established the corpus delicti. The Court also noted that procedural rules may be applied retroactively only where doing so does not impair vested rights or work injustice—finding neither applied here. Thus, the admission of the photocopy comported with fairness and did not violate the accused’s rights.</p>
</details>

## What damages did the Supreme Court affirm and on what authority did it rely for amounts?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Supreme Court affirmed damages awarded by the CA: civil indemnity PHP 75,000; moral damages PHP 75,000; exemplary damages PHP 75,000; and temperate damages PHP 50,000, all with legal interest at 6% per annum from finality until satisfied. The Court specifically relied on People v. Jugueta for the methodology of awarding these amounts and affirmed the CA’s assessment. The awards reflect compensatory and punitive measures appropriate for a murder conviction and are consistent with the Court’s precedents cited in the decision.</p>
</details>

## Explain the Court’s position on the admissibility of "machine copies" when no objection was raised during trial.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court recognized prior jurisprudence that courts are not precluded from accepting in evidence a mere photocopy when no objection was raised at the time of formal offering; evidence not objected to is deemed admitted and can be considered. However, the Court went further: under the 2019 Revised Rules on Evidence, the duplicate itself is admissible unless authenticity is questioned or its admission would be unjust. In this case, the duplicate was temporarily marked during trial and no genuine question as to authenticity was raised; therefore the duplicate was admissible. Nonetheless, the Court distinguished admissibility from evidentiary weight: the machine copy’s primary function was corroborative, not determinative.</p>
</details>

## What legal effect did the Court assign to the accused’s failure to challenge the generic pleading of treachery and premeditation?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court applied Solar’s guidance: if the accused fails to file a timely motion to quash or a bill of particulars to challenge a generic allegation of qualifying circumstances, he waives his right to later contest the sufficiency of the Information on those grounds. Because Lastimosa did not avail himself of those remedies, the Court deemed that he waived his right to challenge the vagueness of the Information’s allegations of treachery and evident premeditation. Consequently, the courts could appreciate and consider those qualifying circumstances in weighing evidence and imposing sentencing.</p>
</details>

## Were there any mitigating or aggravating circumstances affecting penalty, according to the Court?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>No. The Court found that neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstances were present in the case. In the absence of such circumstances, the Court applied the lesser penalty of the two provided under Article 248 for Murder—reclusion perpetua rather than death. The Court also noted that by statute (Republic Act No. 9346), a person sentenced to reclusion perpetua is not eligible for parole under the Indeterminate Sentence Law.</p>
</details>

## How did the Court justify applying the 2019 Rules to a trial whose trial exhibits were marked years prior to their promulgation?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court justified retroactive application of the 2019 Rules on the grounds that procedural laws are generally applicable to pending actions and do not impair substantive rights. It cited precedents explaining that procedural statutes can be retroactively applied to proceedings that are pending, provided such application does not create new obligations or take away vested rights or otherwise work injustice. Here, applying Rule 130 Section 4(c) retroactively did not impair any vested right of the accused nor create substantive new obligations; furthermore, the duplicate’s admission did not produce an unjust result because testimonial evidence independently established the corpus delicti. Therefore retroactive application was permissible and appropriate.</p>
</details>

## If a genuine question of authenticity had been raised regarding the death certificate, how would that have altered admissibility under Rule 130, Sec. 4(c)?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Under Rule 130 Section 4(c), if a genuine question had been raised as to the authenticity of the original, a duplicate would not be admissible to the same extent as the original. That would have required the prosecution to produce either the original document or evidence to authenticate it (e.g., testimony from the custodian or issuer of the death certificate or other means of proving the copy’s fidelity). The burden of addressing the authenticity challenge would fall on the proponent of the duplicate; if the prosecution could not meet the authentication requirement, the court could exclude the duplicate or give it little probative weight. In this case, however, no such genuine question was raised, so the duplicate remained admissible.</p>
</details>

## Reflect on the practical implications for prosecutors in light of the Court’s ruling on duplicates and Solar. What must prosecutors now be careful to do in preparing Information and documentary evidence?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The decision carries two principal practical directives for prosecutors. First, under Solar, when alleging qualifying or aggravating circumstances (like treachery, evident premeditation, abuse of superior strength, cruelty), prosecutors must either state the ultimate facts supporting those circumstances in the Information or attach and reference a resolution finding probable cause that contains such factual details. Failure to do so risks a motion to quash or a bill of particulars by the accused; if the accused does not timely object, he may be deemed to have waived the right to challenge later, but relying on waiver is risky and defensive. Second, regarding documentary evidence, prosecutors should still endeavor to produce originals when feasible, but the Court’s acceptance of duplicates under Rule 130 Section 4(c) means well-prepared authentication (chain of custody, custodial testimony, provenance) and readiness to address authenticity challenges is essential. Prosecutors should retain originals or have measures to authenticate duplicates to avoid exclusion and preserve probative weight.</p>
</details>

## Consider the Court's assessment of witness delay in coming forward. How did the Court treat the timing of witnesses' appearances?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court acknowledged the defense’s point that one of the witnesses surfaced belatedly but found that the delay did not impair their credibility. The RTC and CA had both considered the belated appearance and still found the witnesses credible. The Supreme Court deferred to those credibility findings, noting no compelling reason to discount the witnesses' veracity merely for delayed appearance, especially when they provided consistent and positive eyewitness accounts. The Court observed that absence of immediate reporting does not automatically negate credibility and that the trial courts are best positioned to evaluate such circumstances in context.</p>

## What lessons about the relationship between rules of procedure and fairness does the Court emphasize in applying the 2019 Rules retroactively?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court emphasized that procedural changes may be applied retroactively to pending cases when they do not impair vested rights or produce injustice. The purpose of procedural rules is to prescribe modes of enforcing rights and administering justice, and they are generally applicable to pending proceedings. However, there are exceptions: retroactivity should not be applied where the rule expressly or implicitly excludes pending cases, where it would impair vested rights, or where applying it would be infeasible or work injustice. In this case, retroactive application of Rule 130 Section 4(c) was compatible with fairness because the duplicate's admission did not produce an unjust result and the accused’s rights were not impaired. Thus, procedural reform that promotes efficient and realistic evidentiary practice can be applied to pending proceedings so long as due process and fairness are preserved.</p>

## Conclude by stating the final judgment the Supreme Court rendered.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals’ February 11, 2022 Decision. Accused-appellant Ybo Lastimosa was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Murder and sentenced to reclusion perpetua. He was ordered to pay the heirs of the victim PHP 75,000 (civil indemnity), PHP 75,000 (moral damages), PHP 75,000 (exemplary damages), and PHP 50,000 (temperate damages), with interest at 6% per annum from finality until fully paid. The Court denied his contentions regarding insufficiency of proof and witness credibility, found treachery present but not evident premeditation, and held the photocopy of the death certificate admissible under Rule 130, Sec. 4(c) of the 2019 Revised Rules on Evidence.</p>

## Critically analyze whether the Court’s reliance on retroactivity doctrine could have any potential unfair consequences in other cases.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court’s acceptance of retroactive application of the 2019 Rules is grounded in established doctrine that procedural rules may be applied to pending cases when they do not affect substantive rights. While this is consistent with precedent, potential unfair consequences could arise in cases where the procedural change materially alters evidentiary burdens or strategic expectations midstream—for instance, if a court retroactively permits admission of duplicates that the defense had relied on the hospital rules to contest, or if a new rule removes a protective evidentiary requirement upon which a defendant had relied to obtain exclusion of damaging evidence. The Court sought to circumscribe such unfairness by requiring absence of injustice or impairment of vested rights. Nonetheless, litigants must be alert: retroactive procedural changes can change litigation tactics, and parties who relied on preexisting procedures could perceive procedural disadvantage. The Court’s approach tries to balance efficiency and fairness, but it places responsibility on courts to carefully assess injustice risks before applying procedural changes retroactively.</p>

## If you were the defense counsel, what preserved objections or motions could you have filed at trial to preserve issues for appeal based on the defects discussed in this case?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>There are several procedural steps defense counsel could have pursued. First, in response to the Information’s general allegations of treachery and evident premeditation, defense counsel could have filed a motion to quash under Section 3(e), Rule 117 or a motion for a bill of particulars seeking the ultimate facts supporting those qualifying circumstances—Solar expressly requires these remedies to preserve the right to later challenge the adequacy of the Information. Second, when the prosecution offered the photocopy of the death certificate, counsel could have objected to its admissibility under the best evidence rule (as then articulated), demanding production of the original or seeking authentication through the custodian of records or the issuing funeral manager/medico-legal officer. Third, defense counsel could have moved to exclude or strike testimony by witnesses for lack of foundation or on hearsay grounds where applicable, and made contemporaneous objections to the admission of documentary exhibits so as to preserve those issues on appeal. Finally, counsel could have moved for a bill of particulars as to eyewitness identification details (position, lighting, distance) to expose inconsistencies and demand specificity. These motions would have preserved the grounds that later were partially litigated but not preserved by timely procedural challenges.</p>

## Discuss whether the presence of multiple eyewitnesses with varying distances (2–3 meters and 6 meters) supports reliable identification under the Court’s assessment.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court found the eyewitness identifications reliable despite the witnesses being at slightly different distances (Ca�eda at two to three meters and Cortes at about six meters). It assessed reliability by considering descriptiveness, consistency, and the witnesses’ ability to identify the accused in court. Ca�eda provided details—number of shots, part of the body hit, immediacy of reaction—emphasizing his presence and clarity of perception, even asserting presence of mind. Cortes corroborated seeing the shooting and identified the accused as well. Distance alone does not automatically vitiate identification; crucial are conditions such as lighting, duration of observation, proximity, and witness certainty. Here both witnesses positively identified the accused and testified to specifics that were complementary. The Court deferred to trial courts’ credibility determinations, finding no compelling reason to disturb the assessments that these distances were compatible with reliable observation and identification.</p>

## How does this decision illustrate the balance between form (procedural rules) and substance (truth-finding) in criminal trials?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>This decision reflects the Court’s effort to balance procedural formality with substantive truth-finding. On the procedural side, Solar emphasizes specificity in pleadings so that accused persons have clarity on alleged qualifying circumstances and may make informed defenses. The Court enforced Solar’s waiver rule, protecting the right to specific pleadings. On the evidentiary side, the 2019 Rules’ liberalization of admissibility of duplicates advances practicality and substantive truth-seeking by allowing corroborative duplicates when authenticity is not genuinely disputed. The Court therefore upheld procedural protections (requiring specificity or timely objection) while embracing rules that facilitate admission of reliable evidence for truth-finding. The judgment demonstrates that procedure is respected to the extent it ensures fairness, but procedural technicalities should not obstruct the determination of the underlying facts when sufficient reliable evidence exists.</p>

## What is the key takeaway about the evidentiary weight of a duplicate document after this decision?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The key takeaway is that a duplicate (including a photocopy) is admissible to the same extent as the original under the 2019 Revised Rules on Evidence unless a genuine question is raised as to authenticity or its admission would be unjust or inequitable. However, admissibility does not equate to substantive probative weight: the court must still evaluate the duplicate's evidentiary weight in the context of all evidence. In this case, the photocopy corroborated testimonial evidence and thus reinforced the prosecution’s proof, but the conviction rested on the totality of evidence, particularly credible eyewitness identifications, rather than on the duplicate alone.</p>
