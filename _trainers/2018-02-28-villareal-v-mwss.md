## Who are the parties in this case and in what capacity are they acting?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The principal parties are Orlando A. Villareal (the judgment debtor) and the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) (the judgment creditor). The petition to the Supreme Court was brought by Daniel A. Villareal, Jr. on behalf of Orlando, contesting the MeTC's issuance of a writ of execution and a sheriff's notice to vacate and pay. At earlier stages, MWSS was the plaintiff in the unlawful detainer action that resulted in a judgment ordering Orlando and those claiming under him to vacate the subject premises and pay compensation.</p>

<p>Procedurally, the MeTC (Metropolitan Trial Court) of Quezon City, RTC (Regional Trial Court) Branches, and finally the Supreme Court are the courts involved. The MeTC issued the writ of execution and sheriff's notice; RTC Branch 215 denied Orlando's certiorari petition challenging those acts; the Supreme Court reviewed the RTC ruling under Rule 45 and ultimately reversed and set aside the RTC decision and order.</p>
</details>

## Summarize the antecedent facts that led to this petition.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The case began with an unlawful detainer case, "MWSS v. Orlando A. Villareal and others," originally dismissed by the MeTC in October 2000. On appeal, RTC Branch 96 reversed that dismissal and, in a decision dated September 27, 2002, ordered Orlando and those claiming under him to vacate the premises and pay reasonable compensation from November 7, 1997. That RTC decision became final and executory on December 15, 2002.</p>

<p>MWSS filed a Motion for Issuance of Writ of Execution on May 17, 2004 (within five years of the entry of judgment). Orlando filed a Comment/Opposition on July 2, 2004, invoking R.A. No. 7279, and asking that execution be held in abeyance pending compliance. However, the MeTC did not act on the motion promptly; it issued an Order granting the motion only on July 28, 2014, and finally issued a Writ of Execution on October 26, 2015. A sheriff's notice to vacate and pay was sent on April 19, 2016. Daniel (on behalf of Orlando) filed a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 with RTC Branch 215 on April 20, 2016, asserting that the five-year period under Section 6, Rule 39 was violated because the actual writ was issued more than 10 years after entry of judgment. The RTC dismissed the petition on February 9, 2017 and denied reconsideration on May 17, 2017. This Rule 45 petition to the Supreme Court followed.</p>
</details>

## What was the dispositive order of the RTC-Branch 96 in September 2002?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The RTC-Branch 96 reversed the MeTC's dismissal and ordered that Orlando and all persons claiming rights under him vacate the premises located at No. 18, V. Heizer St., Balara Filters, Quezon City, and surrender possession to MWSS. It also ordered payment of ₱2,500.00 as reasonable compensation from November 7, 1997 until possession was restored to MWSS. This decision was rendered on September 27, 2002 and was entered as final and executory on December 15, 2002.</p>
</details>

## When did the RTC decision become final and executory and why is that date important?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The RTC decision became final and executory on December 15, 2002, which is the date of entry of judgment as recorded by the RTC Clerk of Court. This date is important because Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court measures the five-year period for execution by motion from the date of entry (i.e., finality) of the judgment. Thus, December 15, 2002 is the starting point for computing whether MWSS' motion and the court's issuance of the writ occurred within that five-year prescriptive period.</p>
</details>

## What action did MWSS take to enforce the RTC judgment, and when was it filed?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>MWSS filed a Motion for Issuance of Writ of Execution with the MeTC on May 17, 2004. This filing was within five years from the date of entry of judgment (December 15, 2002), satisfying the first of the two acts that jurisprudence requires to be completed within the five-year period for an execution by motion to be valid.</p>
</details>

## Describe the MeTC's timeline of decisions and writ issuance after MWSS filed its motion.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>After MWSS filed the motion on May 17, 2004, Orlando filed a Comment/Opposition on July 2, 2004. The MeTC took no immediate action for many years. It issued an Order granting the Motion for Issuance of Writ of Execution only on July 28, 2014—more than ten years after entry of judgment—and thereafter finally issued the Writ of Execution on October 26, 2015. A sheriff's notice to vacate and pay was subsequently sent on April 19, 2016. Thus, although MWSS filed the motion within five years, the MeTC did not issue the writ until more than twelve years after entry of judgment.</p>
</details>

## What remedy did petitioners initially pursue in the RTC-Branch 215 and on what ground?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Petitioners (Daniel on behalf of Orlando) filed a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 with RTC-Branch 215 on April 20, 2016. They challenged the MeTC's issuance of the Writ of Execution (dated October 26, 2015) and the Sheriff's Notice to Vacate and Pay (dated April 19, 2016), arguing primarily that Section 6, Rule 39's five-year period was violated because the execution was undertaken more than ten years after the judgment had become final and executory. In short, they contended the MeTC no longer had jurisdiction to issue the writ because issuance occurred outside the five-year period required for execution by motion.</p>
</details>

## How did the RTC-Branch 215 rule on that petition and what did petitioners do next?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The RTC-Branch 215 dismissed the petition for certiorari on February 9, 2017, thereby affirming the MeTC's issuance of the writ and the sheriff's notice. Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration, which the RTC denied in an order dated May 17, 2017. Following that denial, petitioners elevated the matter to the Supreme Court via a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45.</p>
</details>

## Why did the Supreme Court entertain the petition under Rule 45 instead of Rule 65?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Supreme Court explained that petitioners raised a question of law — specifically, the proper application of Section 6, Rule 39 (the five-year rule for execution by motion) and the applicable jurisprudence — rather than alleging that the RTC lacked jurisdiction or exercised it with grave abuse amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Rule 45 petitions are proper where only questions of law are raised. The Court contrasted this with Rule 65, which is confined to jurisdictional defects and grave abuse of discretion. Since the alleged errors concerned misapplication of law (a question of law), a Rule 45 petition was the appropriate remedy.</p>
</details>

## Recite the text of Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court as quoted in the decision.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The decision quotes Section 6, Rule 39 as follows: "A final and executory judgment or order may be executed on motion within five (5) years from the date of its entry. After the lapse of such time, and before it is barred by the statute of limitations, a judgment may be enforced by action. The revived judgment may also be enforced by motion within five (5) years from the date of its entry and thereafter by action before it is barred by the statute of limitations."</p>

<p>This provision sets the two modes of execution and the temporal limits: execution by motion within five years from entry, and by independent action thereafter (but before the prescriptive period under substantive law runs, typically ten years under the Civil Code as applied to judgments).</p>
</details>

## Explain the two distinct modes of executing a judgment under Section 6, Rule 39.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Section 6, Rule 39 provides two modes: execution by motion and execution by independent action (revival action). Execution by motion is a summary procedure by which a prevailing party files a motion asking the court that rendered the judgment to issue a writ of execution; it is available only within five years from the date of entry of judgment. If the five-year period lapses without execution by motion, the prevailing party must turn to an independent action — a regular action for the revival/ enforcement of judgment — which must be filed before the judgment is barred by the statute of limitations (the Court identifies this period as ten years under the Civil Code). The decision emphasizes that execution by motion is a matter of right if invoked within five years; beyond that, execution by motion is no longer available and an action is mandatory.</p>
</details>

## According to the Supreme Court's decision, what two acts must be completed within the five-year period for execution by motion to be valid?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Jurisprudence, as reiterated in the decision, requires that two acts be accomplished within the five-year period for execution by motion to be valid: (a) the filing of the motion for the issuance of a writ of execution by the judgment creditor; and (b) the court's actual issuance of the writ of execution. Both acts must fall within the five-year prescriptive period calculated from the date of entry of the judgment.</p>
</details>

## How did the MWSS perform with respect to the two required acts within the five-year period?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>MWSS satisfied the first requirement: it filed the Motion for Issuance of Writ of Execution on May 17, 2004, which was within five years from the entry of judgment on December 15, 2002. However, MWSS did not ensure that the second act — the actual issuance of the writ by the MeTC — occurred within five years. The MeTC issued the writ only on October 26, 2015, more than twelve years after entry. Thus, the second required act occurred outside the five-year period, rendering the issuance invalid under the controlling jurisprudence.</p>
</details>

## What is the jurisprudential rule applied in Olongapo City v. Subic Water and Sewerage Co., Inc., as cited in this decision?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Olongapo City v. Subic Water and Sewerage Co., Inc. applied and explained the Arambulo rule: the jurisdiction of a court to issue a writ of execution by motion exists only within the five-year period from the entry of judgment. If no writ of execution is issued by the court within that five-year period, even if the motion was filed within the period, a writ issued outside the period is null and void. Where no writ was issued within five years, the judgment creditor's only recourse is to file an independent action for revival/enforcement, which must itself be filed within the prescriptive period set by law for enforcing judgments.</p>
</details>

## What was the Supreme Court's conclusion about the MeTC's writ of execution issued on October 26, 2015?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Supreme Court concluded that the writ of execution issued by the MeTC on October 26, 2015 was null and void. The rationale was that issuance occurred well beyond the five-year prescriptive period computed from the entry of judgment (December 15, 2002), and therefore the MeTC had been stripped of jurisdiction to issue such writ at that time. Because the court did not issue the writ within five years, its later issuance could not cure the jurisdictional defect.</p>
</details>

## Explain why a writ issued after the lapse of the five-year period is considered void.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court explained that the limitation in Section 6, Rule 39 as to executing a judgment by motion within five years is jurisdictional in nature: it goes to the very power of the court to act. If the court issues a writ after the five-year period has elapsed, it acts without jurisdiction in that respect; jurisdiction is conferred by law and cannot be created by the parties' consent or by delay. Hence, any writ issued after this period is null and void. The Court relied on prior cases (Arambulo, Ramos, Olongapo City) that held that issuance beyond the five-year window divests the court of jurisdiction to issue such a writ and renders the writ void despite a timely-filed motion.</p>
</details>

## MWSS argued that Orlando's filing of a Comment delayed execution and thus excused the late issuance. How did the Supreme Court respond?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Supreme Court rejected MWSS' contention. It recognized that there are circumstances where delay may be excluded (for instance, when execution is stayed by agreement, by injunction, by appeal operating as a supersedeas, by the death of a party, etc.), or where delay is caused by actions of the judgment debtor, thereby extending the period. However, in this case, the Court found no showing that the execution was stayed by any of the enumerated circumstances, nor that Orlando's comment was sufficient to cause the kind of delay that would toll or suspend the five-year period. Filing a comment or opposition to a motion is a procedural right of the defendant; it does not, ipso facto, operate to extend the court's jurisdictional power to issue the writ beyond the five-year limit. The delay, the Court found, was attributable to the MeTC's inaction, not to any conduct of the debtor that would justify an exception.</p>
</details>

## What exceptions did the Court note where execution by motion after five years has been allowed?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court acknowledged narrow exceptions where execution by motion after the lapse of five years has been permitted, but emphasized that these exceptions share a common denominator: the delay was caused or occasioned by actions of the judgment debtor or incurred for his benefit. The decision cited jurisprudence that allows excluding time during which execution is stayed (by agreement, injunction, appeal operating as supersedeas, death, or otherwise), and that any interruption or delay occasioned by the debtor will extend the time within which the writ may be issued without scire facias. In short, exceptions exist if the debtor actively procured or had caused the delay, or if execution was legally stayed. These exceptional circumstances were not present here.</p>
</details>

## How did the Supreme Court apply Yau v. Silverio, Sr. in analyzing delay and tolled periods?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court referred to Yau v. Silverio, Sr. for the principle that in computing time limits for enforcing a final judgment, periods when execution is stayed (by agreement, injunction, appeal/supersedeas, death, or similar reasons) should be excluded, and any delay occasioned by the debtor should be subtracted from the computation. The Court used this principle to explain when the five-year period may be extended; however, it found no evidence in the record that execution had been legitimately stayed or that the delay was due to the debtor's actions such that it should be excluded. Orlando's filing of a comment did not rise to the kind of action that would automatically suspend the five-year period.</p>
</details>

## What is the legal effect on MWSS of the Supreme Court declaring the writ void?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>By declaring the writ of execution null and void, the Supreme Court removed the basis for the MeTC's enforcement actions (the writ and the sheriff's notice). The RTC's decision and order which had affirmed the MeTC's issuance were reversed and set aside. Practically, this means MWSS cannot proceed to displace Orlando by virtue of the void writ as issued in 2015. The decision underscores that MWSS' remedy by execution no longer stands in light of the jurisdictional defect in the late issuance.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Court's discussion suggests that MWSS' available recourse would have been to file an independent action for the revival/enforcement of the judgment within the statutory period for actions (ten years under the Civil Code as applied to judgments). Whether MWSS still had such recourse would depend on whether that ten-year period had already expired, but the effect of the Court's ruling is that the 2015 writ cannot be the vehicle for enforcement.</p>
</details>

## According to the decision, what is the statute of limitations applicable to an independent action to enforce a judgment?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Supreme Court reiterated that after the five-year period for execution by motion, a judgment may be enforced by independent action, but only before it is barred by the statute of limitations. The Court cited that, under the Civil Code, the period for enforcing a judgment by action is ten years from the finality of the judgment. Thus, an action to revive or enforce the judgment must be filed within ten years from the date of entry (finality) of the judgment.</p>
</details>

## Compute the five-year and ten-year periods applicable to this case based on the entry date of December 15, 2002.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Starting from the date of entry/finality of the RTC decision — December 15, 2002 — the five-year period for execution by motion expired on December 15, 2007. Therefore, any writ of execution issued after December 15, 2007 would be void if the court had not issued it within that five-year window.</p>

<p>The ten-year period for enforcing the judgment by independent action would have expired on December 15, 2012. Thus, as of October 26, 2015 (when the MeTC issued the writ), both the five-year window for execution by motion and the ten-year window for bringing an independent action had already lapsed. The Supreme Court noted these computations in explaining that the MeTC's issuance in 2015 was beyond the court's jurisdiction under the five-year rule, and that the judgment creditor's only recourse after five years is an independent action which must be filed before the ten-year bar.</p>
</details>

## If the judgment creditor files a motion within five years but the court issues the writ after five years, what remedy does jurisprudence provide, according to this decision?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Jurisprudence as articulated and reiterated in the decision holds that if the court fails to issue the writ within the five-year period, then any writ issued after the lapse is null and void, and the judgment creditor's remedy is to initiate an independent action to revive or enforce the judgment. That independent action must be filed before the judgment is barred by the statute of limitations (ten years under the Civil Code). The timely filing of the motion alone does not cure the defect if the court's issuance of the writ falls outside the five-year window.</p>
</details>

## The decision emphasizes that the five-year limit "goes to the very jurisdiction of the Court." Explain what this means and its implications.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>When the Court says the five-year limit "goes to the very jurisdiction of the Court," it means compliance with the five-year prescription is not a mere procedural nicety but a substantive prerequisite to the court's power to issue a writ of execution. If the issuing is attempted beyond that period, the court is acting without legal authority in that specific respect. The implication is that a writ issued after the five-year period is void ab initio and may not be validated by the parties' failure to object. Jurisdictional requirements cannot be waived or conferred by consent and are enforceable at any time; therefore, the late issuance cannot be cured by laches, silence, or other procedural steps.</p>
</details>

## How did the Supreme Court distinguish between Rule 45 and Rule 65 remedies in this case?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Supreme Court highlighted the difference in scope between Rule 45 and Rule 65 remedies. A Rule 45 petition for review on certiorari is generally limited to questions of law and challenges whether the law was properly applied to the facts, whereas a Rule 65 special civil action (certiorari) is confined to jurisdictional issues — whether the court had jurisdiction and whether there was grave abuse of discretion constituting lack or excess of jurisdiction. In this case, the question raised was the proper application of the law (Section 6, Rule 39), making Rule 45 the appropriate vehicle. The Court stressed that petitioners were not contesting the RTC's jurisdiction per se but the correctness of the legal ruling, which is a question of law under Rule 45.</p>
</details>

## What previous cases did the Supreme Court rely on to support its ruling?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The decision relied on a body of jurisprudence that included Arambulo (as explained in Olongapo City v. Subic Water and Sewerage Co., Inc.), Ramos v. Garciano, Ysidoro v. Justice Leonardo De Castro (for distinctions between Rule 45 and Rule 65), Yau v. Silverio, Sr. (on exclusion of time during stays or delays caused by the debtor), Rubio v. Alabata, Phil. Veterans Bank v. Solid Homes, Inc., Camacho v. CA, and Villeza v. German Management and Services, Inc., among others. The Court used these precedents to restate the rule that both filing the motion and issuance of the writ must occur within five years, and to outline the limited exceptions where delay could be excused.</p>
</details>

## What was MWSS's principal argument in defense of the MeTC's late issuance of the writ?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>MWSS argued, among other things, that the five-year period under Rule 39, Section 6 runs only against the judgment obligee (i.e., the party seeking execution) and not against the court that resolves/decides the motion. In other words, MWSS maintained that filing the motion within five years sufficed, and any delay caused by the court's issuance should not invalidate the process. It also contended that Orlando's filing of a Comment/Opposition caused the delay in issuance, implying that such procedural resistance by the debtor justified the late issuance.</p>
</details>

## How did the Supreme Court address MWSS's contention that the five-year rule runs only against the judgment obligee?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Supreme Court rejected MWSS's contention. It held that the five-year prescriptive period applies both to the judgment creditor (who must file the motion within five years) and to the court (which must actually issue the writ within the same five-year window). The Court stressed jurisprudence requiring both acts to be completed within five years and explained that failure by the court to issue the writ within that time renders the writ void. The Court therefore concluded that the MeTC had been stripped of jurisdiction to issue the writ in 2015.</p>
</details>

## Does the decision permit courts to apply equitable considerations to override the prescriptive periods?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Supreme Court acknowledged that in a "plethora of cases" it has applied liberal interpretations and equitable considerations when strict adherence to time bars would result in manifest wrong or injustice. However, it cautioned that such equitable exceptions remain narrow and are the exception rather than the rule. The decision emphasized that the law's prescribed time limitations to enforce judgments aim to prevent the winning party from sleeping on his rights, and the Court cannot set aside the statute of limitations every time equity is invoked. In this specific case, no equitable ground justified an exception to the five-year rule because the delay was attributable to the court's inaction, not to the debtor's conduct that would toll the period.</p>
</details>

## After the Supreme Court's ruling, what happened to the RTC Decision dated February 9, 2017 and the Order dated May 17, 2017?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Supreme Court reversed and set aside both the RTC Decision dated February 9, 2017 and the RTC Order dated May 17, 2017. These RTC rulings had dismissed the certiorari petition and denied reconsideration, thereby affirming the MeTC's issuance of the writ and the sheriff's notice. The Supreme Court's reversal nullified the RTC's validation of the MeTC's late writ and restored the illegitimacy of the MeTC's execution acts.</p>
</details>

## What is the teaching or ratio decidendi of this case?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The ratio is clear: for an execution by motion under Section 6, Rule 39 to be valid, two acts must occur within five years from the entry of judgment — the filing of the motion and the court's actual issuance of the writ. If the court issues the writ after this five-year period, the writ is void because the court lacks jurisdiction to issue it at that time. Filing a comment by the debtor does not automatically toll or suspend the five-year period unless the delay is caused by circumstances that legally stay execution or are attributable to actions of the debtor. The judgment creditor's remedy, if the writ is not issued within five years, is to file an independent action for revival/enforcement within the statutory period (ten years) prescribed for such actions.</p>
</details>

## What practical advice for judgment creditors and courts can be derived from this decision?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The decision underscores two practical imperatives. First, judgment creditors must not only file their motion for execution within five years from entry but must also be vigilant to ensure that the court acts to issue the writ within that same five-year period. A timely motion alone may not suffice if the court fails to act. Second, courts must recognize that their authority to issue writs by motion is time-bound; inaction that pushes issuance beyond the five-year window strips them of jurisdiction to issue the writ. Both parties and courts should therefore act with urgency and monitor the timeline to avoid jurisdictional nullities.</p>
</details>

## If you were representing MWSS after the Supreme Court's decision, what legal options remain consistent with the Court's discussion?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Consistent with the Court's discussion, MWSS's viable legal option, in principle, would have been to file an independent action to revive or enforce the judgment (a complaint in a regular court), which must be filed before the judgment is barred by the statute of limitations — ten years from entry. However, given the dates in this case (entry on December 15, 2002 and the MeTC's writ issued in 2015), the ten-year period would have expired on December 15, 2012. The Supreme Court's opinion indicates that an independent action is the required remedy after the lapse of five years, but the creditor must be mindful of the ten-year bar. Practically, if ten years have passed without filing such an action, the judgment may be time-barred.</p>

<p>Note: The Court did not explicitly adjudicate whether MWSS was time-barred in this particular instance; it set aside the late writ and reiterated the available procedural remedies and their temporal limits. Any further strategy would depend on the precise dates and whether any tolling or exceptions applied — matters not found in the record before the Supreme Court for this ruling.</p>
</details>

## What role did Section 2, Rule 36 and cases like Phil. Veterans Bank v. Solid Homes, Inc. play in the Court's reasoning?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The decision references Section 2, Rule 36 to equate the date of entry with the date of finality, which establishes the starting point for the computation of the five-year and ten-year periods. It also cites Phil. Veterans Bank v. Solid Homes, Inc. to support the proposition that a final and executory judgment may be executed by motion within five years or by action for revival within ten years, reinforcing the dual-timeline framework for enforcement. These citations serve to anchor the time computations and confirm the established rule on available remedies and their respective temporal limits.</p>
</details>

## How did the Court treat the filing of Orlando's Comment/Opposition? Was this treated as a stay of execution?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court acknowledged that Orlando filed a Comment/Opposition to MWSS' motion. However, it did not treat that filing as a legal stay of execution that would toll or exclude time from the computation of the five-year period. The Court explained that the record did not show that execution was stayed "by agreement of the parties for a definite time, by injunction, by the taking of an appeal or writ of error so as to operate as a supersedeas, by the death of a party or otherwise." The filing of a comment is a procedural right and, in the absence of circumstances showing that the delay was attributable to Orlando and that it legally suspended the period, the comment did not justify the MeTC's late issuance of the writ. In short, a mere comment does not automatically equate to a stay that would extend the court's jurisdiction to issue a writ after five years.</p>
</details>

## Discuss the Court's references to equity and the caution it provides about invoking equitable relief to circumvent time bars.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court recognized prior decisions where it has applied equitable considerations to mitigate the harshness of strict time bars when their strict enforcement would lead to manifest injustice. It cited Villeza v. German Management to illustrate that liberal interpretation may be warranted in extraordinary circumstances. However, the Court emphasized that such equitable relief remains an exception and should not become a general rule that allows prevailing parties to disregard statutory time periods. The Court stressed that statutes of limitation and the five-year rule for execution serve important policy reasons — notably preventing plaintiffs from sleeping on their rights — and therefore the Court must be cautious before setting them aside in the name of equity. In the present case, the equities did not justify excusing the MeTC's prolonged inaction that led to issuance beyond the five-year period.</p>
</details>

## What is the significance of the statement "jurisdiction of courts is solely conferred by law and not by express or implied will of the parties"?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>This statement underscores the doctrine that jurisdictional prerequisites are not subject to waiver by parties' conduct or acquiescence. Even if both the prevailing party and the judgment debtor were to agree to a late issuance or fail to object, a court acting past its jurisdictional limits cannot derive jurisdiction from the parties' consent. The Court invoked this principle to reject MWSS' argument that the five-year rule ran only against the creditor; the rule is statutory and jurisdictional in nature, so the court cannot issue a writ after the period simply because the creditor acted within five years or because the debtor failed to prevent issuance.</p>
</details>

## If a court issues a writ outside the five-year period and it is void, does the failure to object by the debtor validate it? Explain based on this decision.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>No. The decision is categorical that a writ issued after the five-year period is void, and the failure to object does not validate it. The Court emphasized that jurisdiction is conferred by law, not by the parties' consent or silence. Therefore, a void writ cannot be cured by the parties' inaction. The Court relied on prior cases to hold that the nullity of a writ issued beyond the five-year time frame stands irrespective of whether objections were formally raised at the time.</p>
</details>

## What were the procedural deficiencies, if any, that the Supreme Court attributed to the MeTC?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Supreme Court pointed out that the MeTC delayed action on MWSS' motion for more than a decade. Although MWSS filed the motion in May 2004 (within the five-year period), the MeTC did not issue an Order granting the motion until July 28, 2014, and the writ of execution was only issued on October 26, 2015 — both events occurring long after the five-year window closed on December 15, 2007. The Court characterized this inaction as fatal because the court's power to issue the writ was time-bound; by the time the MeTC acted to issue the writ, it lacked jurisdiction to do so. The procedural deficiency thus is the prolonged failure by the MeTC to issue the writ within the legally prescribed period.</p>

## How does this decision protect the rights of judgment debtors?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The decision protects judgment debtors by enforcing the temporal limitation on the courts' power to execute judgments summarily. By holding that a writ issued outside the five-year period is void, the Court ensures that debtors are not subject to indefinite exposure to summary execution based on stale judgments. The rule also incentivizes judgment creditors and courts to act promptly and prevents courts from using lax or delayed processes to displace debtors long after the judgment has become stale. The decision therefore strikes a balance between the creditor's right to satisfaction and the debtor's interest in repose and legal certainty.</p>

## Are there any indications in the decision about whether MWSS had an obligation to move the MeTC to act more promptly? If so, explain.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>While the decision does not prescribe a specific affirmative duty beyond filing the motion, it repeatedly emphasizes the practical reality that filing the motion alone is insufficient if the court later fails to issue the writ within five years. The Court's admonition—rooted in the purpose of the five-year rule and its citations to prior jurisprudence—implicitly instructs judgment creditors to be vigilant and to take reasonable steps to ensure the court acts within the prescriptive period. The ruling underscores that the winning party cannot "sleep on [its] right" and must pursue enforcement with due diligence; otherwise, the judicial remedy may be lost or become time-barred. The decision pivots responsibility not only to the court but also to the prevailing party to secure timely issuance.</p>

## Summarize the final disposition of this case.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Supreme Court granted the petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 and reversed and set aside the RTC Decision dated February 9, 2017 and the RTC Order dated May 17, 2017 in Case No. R-QZN-16-03654-CV. The Court declared the MeTC's Writ of Execution dated October 26, 2015 null and void because issuance occurred after the five-year period mandated by Section 6, Rule 39. The petition was granted on that legal ground, and the MeTC's and RTC's affirmations of the writ were invalidated.</p>

## Pose a hypothetical: if the MeTC had issued the writ on December 1, 2007, would the writ have been valid? Apply the rule as stated in the decision.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Applying the rule as stated in the decision, if the MeTC had issued the writ on December 1, 2007, that issuance would have been within the five-year period that began on December 15, 2002 and ended on December 15, 2007. Because both the filing of the motion (May 17, 2004) and the court's issuance (December 1, 2007) would have occurred within the five-year window, the writ would have been valid and the MeTC would have had jurisdiction to execute the judgment by motion. The Court's jurisprudence requires both acts to occur within the five-year period, and in this hypothetical they would have both been completed timely.</p>

## As a closing analytic question: why is strict adherence to the five-year rule important for the legal system, according to the Court's discussion?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court explains that strict adherence to the five-year rule fosters legal certainty and prevents the undermining of the statute of limitations and policies that encourage diligence. The rule prevents prevailing parties from indefinitely delaying enforcement while preserving the jurisdictional boundaries of courts. It prevents courts (through inaction) from creating a situation where enforcement is attempted long after events have become stale, potentially exposing debtors to untimely deprivations. While equity may sometimes warrant flexible application, the Court cautions that such flexibility is the exception, not the norm, because permitting routine exceptions would erode the policy behind the prescribed limitations and encourage “sleeping on rights,” which the limitations seek to prevent. Thus, the five-year rule is both a jurisdictional safeguard and a policy tool to promote diligence and repose.</p>
