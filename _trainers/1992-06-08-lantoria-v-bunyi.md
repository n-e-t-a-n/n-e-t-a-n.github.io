## Who are the parties in this administrative case and what is the nature of the complaint?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The complainant in the administrative case is Cesar L. Lantoria, and the respondent is Atty. Irineo L. Bunyi, a member of the Philippine Bar. Lantoria filed an administrative complaint asserting that Atty. Bunyi committed acts amounting to graft and corruption, dishonesty, conduct unbecoming of an Integrated Bar member, corruption of the judge and bribery, in connection with Bunyi's handling of three civil cases (Civil Case Nos. 81, 83 and 88) pending before the Municipal Court of Esperanza, Agusan del Sur. The factual core of the complaint is that Bunyi, acting as counsel for Mrs. Constancia Mascarinas, allegedly prepared draft judgments for the defaulted defendants and transmitted these drafts to the trial judge, purportedly influencing the judge’s rulings in favor of his client. The complaint therefore charges unethical conduct and seeks disciplinary action against Bunyi for his conduct toward the judiciary while acting as a lawyer in those cases.</p>
</details>

## What were Civil Case Nos. 81, 83 and 88 about and who were the parties in those cases?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The three civil cases involved the ejection of squatters from a farm in Esperanza, Agusan del Sur. Mrs. Constancia M. Mascarinas was the party represented by respondent Atty. Bunyi; she was alleged to be the owner of the farm. Cesar L. Lantoria was the manager and supervisor of the farm and received a monthly allowance in that capacity. The defendants in the ejection cases were declared in default, making the stage appropriate for the entry of judgment, which is when the question of the draft decisions arises. The cases were assigned to the Municipal Court of Esperanza, where Judge Vicente Galicia was acting municipal judge; he was concurrently the regular municipal judge of Bayugan, Agusan del Sur.</p>
</details>

## What written communications are central to the complaint, and what are their dates?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Three letters form the documentary core of the complaint: (1) a letter from Lantoria to Bunyi dated 23 April 1974; (2) a letter from Bunyi to Lantoria dated 1 June 1974; and (3) an earlier letter from Bunyi to Lantoria dated 4 March 1974. These letters indicate communications about the preparation and delivery of draft decisions in the three defaulted civil cases and contain instructions or requests regarding the handling of the draft judgments with Judge Galicia.</p>
</details>

## Summarize the content and significance of the 23 April 1974 letter from Lantoria to Bunyi.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The 23 April 1974 letter from Lantoria to Bunyi, written from Butuan City, acknowledges Bunyi's willingness to prepare the corresponding judgments for the three defaulted cases and reports that Judge Galicia had no objection and even recommended Bunyi mail the decisions through Lantoria to be delivered to the judge. The letter expresses that Lantoria would communicate any developments and extends courteous regards. This letter is significant because it establishes that Lantoria was acting as an intermediary and suggests a pre-existing understanding or communication between Lantoria and Judge Galicia regarding the submission of draft decisions prepared by Bunyi. It is part of the factual foundation upon which the complaint alleges undue influence or improper communication facilitating the entry of decisions prepared by counsel.</p>
</details>

## What did the 1 June 1974 letter from Bunyi to Lantoria state, and why is it important?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The 1 June 1974 letter from Bunyi to Lantoria explains that Bunyi had finally prepared the three decisions awaited by Judge Galicia, apologizes for delay due to busy schedule, and encloses the three draft decisions against the defaulted defendants. Bunyi stated he was not sure whether the drafts would "suit" Judge Galicia but requested Lantoria to facilitate submission and to communicate any suggestions or corrections from the judge. He explicitly requested that Lantoria mediate with Judge Galicia and seek each signed copy for Bunyi’s files. The letter is important because it is an admission by Bunyi that he prepared drafts of the decisions and intended that these drafts be presented to the judge through an intermediary (Lantoria). This admission is central to the administrative finding that Bunyi engaged in conduct that gave the appearance of attempting to influence the court.</p>
</details>

## What did the 4 March 1974 letter from Bunyi to Lantoria request?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The 4 March 1974 letter from Bunyi to Lantoria was a confidential and personal request. Bunyi stated that inside an envelope addressed to Judge Galicia were the decisions and orders which the judge had told Bunyi to prepare and that the judge would sign them. Bunyi asked Lantoria to deliver the envelope to Judge Galicia "as if you have no knowledge and information and that you have not opened it" unless the information came from the judge himself. He suggested delivering the envelope at the judge's residence during the weekend or at Bayugan if the judge were there, and urged Lantoria to expedite receiving signed copies for Bunyi’s hold. The request is significant because it indicates not only that Bunyi prepared drafts but also that he wanted the transmission to be handled covertly through Lantoria, which creates an appearance of impropriety concerning direct or private communications with the judge outside formal court processes.</p>
</details>

## When was the administrative complaint filed with the Supreme Court, and on what primary evidence was it based?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The administrative complaint was filed by Cesar L. Lantoria with the Supreme Court on 11 April 1977, three years after the events and letters of 1974. The complaint was primarily based on the three letters of 4 March, 23 April, and 1 June 1974, which were attached to the complaint and which outlined Bunyi's preparation of draft decisions and his instructions for their delivery to Judge Galicia via Lantoria. These letters constituted the documentary basis for the charges that Bunyi prepared decisions and attempted to influence the judge.</p>
</details>

## How did respondent Bunyi respond to the administrative complaint?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Respondent Bunyi admitted the existence of at least the 1 June 1974 letter and explained its context in a motion to dismiss and later in his pleadings. He contended that his drafting of the decisions stemmed from the insistence of the complainant, by way of multiple letters requesting expedited disposition, and from a prior understanding among the judge, the complainant, and perhaps the judge's own request that Bunyi prepare drafts to assist the overburdened judge. Bunyi characterized his drafts as mere "drafts" subject to the judge's suggestions or modifications and denied offering any gift or consideration to Judge Galicia to influence the judge. He apologized for any improprieties and promised to be more careful in the future. He also later alleged that by the time the complaint was filed, Judge Galicia and Mrs. Mascarinas were deceased, which appears to be an explanatory fact he raised in his memorandum.</p>
</details>

## What procedural steps did the Supreme Court take after the complaint was filed?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>After Lantoria filed the administrative complaint on 11 April 1977, the Supreme Court, by resolution dated 28 November 1977, referred the case to the Solicitor General for investigation, report and recommendation. The Solicitor General conducted proceedings and submitted a report on 21 July 1980 that included findings and a recommendation for disciplinary action. The case was then heard before the Court, with respondent filing motions, manifestations, and memoranda; hearings were set and postponed at various dates, and the Solicitor General and respondent appeared at subsequent hearings. The procedural history shows an investigation by the Solicitor General and the opportunity for respondent to submit defenses and a memorandum before the Supreme Court rendered its decision.</p>
</details>

## What were the key findings of the Solicitor General in his report?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Solicitor General found that: (a) the letters of Atty. Bunyi dated 4 March and 1 June 1974 showed that Bunyi had prepared drafts of the decisions in Civil Case Nos. 81, 83 and 88 and had submitted them to Judge Vicente Galicia through complainant Lantoria; (b) those letters indicated prior communications between Bunyi and Judge Galicia regarding the preparation of the decisions; and (c) although complainant later withdrew his complaint and claimed he had lost originals of the letters, such withdrawal and loss did not negate Bunyi’s own admissions—Bunyi had acknowledged preparing the drafts and had confirmed the letters’ existence in his motion to dismiss. Based on these findings, the Solicitor General concluded that Bunyi had engaged in highly unethical and unprofessional conduct by failing to help promote judicial independence and by engaging in acts that could influence judicial determination, and recommended that Bunyi be suspended from the practice of law for one year.</p>
</details>

## Did complainant Lantoria withdraw his complaint, and what effect did that have on the proceedings?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Yes, complainant Lantoria submitted a letter in which he prayed that the complaint be considered withdrawn, on the ground that he "could hardly substantiate" his charges and was "no longer interested to prosecute" them. However, the Solicitor General and the Supreme Court proceeded with the investigation and adjudication despite the withdrawal because respondent himself had admitted the existence of the letters and that he had prepared the drafts. The Court explicitly agreed with the Solicitor General's observation that the merits of the case should be determined notwithstanding the complainant's withdrawal, since the respondent’s own admissions established the facts necessary to evaluate whether his conduct violated professional ethics. Thus, the withdrawal did not prevent disciplinary action.</p>
</details>

## What admission by respondent was crucial for the Court's determination?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The crucial admission was that respondent Atty. Bunyi had indeed prepared draft judgments for the three defaulted cases and had transmitted or arranged their transmission to Judge Vicente Galicia through complainant Lantoria. Bunyi admitted the existence of the letters and the fact of his preparation of the drafts—either in his motion to dismiss or in subsequent pleadings. This admission meant the Court did not have to rely solely on the complainant's withdrawn complaint or lost originals; instead, the respondent’s own statements formed an evidentiary basis to assess whether his conduct violated ethical canons.</p>
</details>

## What legal or ethical standard did the Supreme Court apply to decide the case?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Supreme Court applied Canon No. 3 of the Canons of Professional Ethics as the governing standard at the time the conduct occurred. Canon No. 3 prohibits attempts to exert personal influence on the court, including marked attention or unusual hospitality to judges, private communications or arguments with a judge on the merits of a pending cause, and any device or attempt to gain special personal consideration or favor from a judge. The Court also referenced the new Code of Professional Responsibility promulgated in 1988 to show continuity in the ethical principle, namely Canon 13 ("A lawyer shall rely upon the merits of his cause and refrain from any impropriety which tends to influence, or gives the appearance of influencing the court") and Rule 13.01 ("A lawyer shall not extend extraordinary attention or hospitality to, nor seek opportunity for, cultivating familiarity with judges"). These standards were used to evaluate whether Bunyi's drafting and handling of the decisions through an intermediary amounted to an attempt to influence the court or conduct unbecoming a lawyer and officer of the court.</p>
</details>

## How did the Court interpret the acts of preparing draft decisions and transmitting them to the judge via Lantoria?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court viewed the act of preparing draft decisions and transmitting them to the judge through an intermediary as conduct that amounted to attempting to influence the court and as conduct unbecoming of a lawyer. Even though there was no evidence that Bunyi offered gifts or other explicit consideration to the judge, the Court held that the behavior nonetheless contravened Canon No. 3 because it involved private communications and the lawyer's role in producing judicial determinations outside the neutral court process. The Court emphasized that whether or not explicit corruption or bribery was proven, the preparation of drafts by counsel and the delivery through a party's agent, especially coupled with requests to deliver "as if you have no knowledge," creates an appearance of impropriety and undermines judicial independence. The Court therefore found Bunyi guilty of unethical practice for attempting to influence the court.</p>
</details>

## Was there evidence that respondent bribed or gave gifts to Judge Galicia?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>No, the record did not contain evidence that respondent Bunyi gave gifts or other tangible consideration to Judge Galicia to influence the judge. Respondent expressly denied offering any gift or consideration in his memorandum. The Solicitor General and the Court did not find proof of bribery or corrupt exchange. Despite the absence of proof of bribery, the Court held that Bunyi's actions still constituted unethical conduct under Canon No. 3 because the conduct created an appearance of attempting to influence the judge and involved private arrangements for the preparation and submission of judicial decisions by counsel.</p>
</details>

## Why did the Court consider the absence of a formal proof of bribery not dispositive?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court recognized that proof of bribery would be a separate and more serious offense, but it emphasized that the absence of bribery evidence did not negate the unethical nature of Bunyi's actions. Canon No. 3 condemns attempts to exert personal influence and private communications with a judge regarding pending matters; such improprieties can exist independently of an actual corrupt exchange. The Court reasoned that the mere preparation of draft decisions by counsel and their private transmission to the judge through an agent, especially with instructions for covert delivery, undermines the independence and proper functioning of the judiciary and warrants disciplinary action. Hence, even absent bribery, the conduct was sanctionable because it violated professional norms requiring lawyers to avoid conduct that tends to influence the court or gives the appearance of influencing it.</p>
</details>

## How did the Court treat Bunyi’s explanation that the drafts were prepared at the judge’s request and as a convenience?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Respondent argued that he prepared the draft decisions because of requests and insistence by complainant and because Judge Galicia considered such preparation a help given his heavy caseload, holding two salas. The Court acknowledged this explanation and the fact that draft judgments can be useful in assisting overburdened courts. However, the Court did not accept this justification as absolving Bunyi from responsibility. Even if the judge requested help, the appropriate procedure would require transparent, court-sanctioned assistance, not private arrangements or clandestine transmission through a party's agent that risked compromising the court’s independence or creating the appearance of special access for counsel. The Court found that Bunyi's conduct—preparing drafts and orchestrating their delivery through an interested party—violated Canon No. 3 because it created a risk of undue influence and gave the appearance of impropriety regardless of any asserted benevolent intent.</p>
</details>

## What was the Court's final disposition and sanction against respondent Bunyi?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Supreme Court found respondent Atty. Irineo L. Bunyi guilty of unethical practice for attempting to influence the court and conduct unbecoming of a lawyer and an officer of the court. As disciplinary action, the Court suspended Bunyi from the practice of law for a period of one year from the date of notice of the decision. The Court also ordered that the decision be entered in the bar records of the respondent and directed the Court Administrator to inform the different courts of the suspension.</p>
</details>

## What portion of the Canons of Professional Ethics did the Court cite as violated, and what does that canon say?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court cited Canon No. 3 of the Canons of Professional Ethics as the relevant ethical provision violated by Bunyi's conduct. Canon No. 3 condemns attempts to exert personal influence on the court. It warns that marked attention and unusual hospitality by a lawyer to a judge, not called for by personal relations of the parties, subject both judge and lawyer to misconstructions of motive and should be avoided. The canon further states that a lawyer should not privately communicate or argue with a judge as to the merits of a pending cause and deserves rebuke and denunciation for any device or attempt to gain special personal consideration or favor. It emphasizes that a self-respecting independence in discharging professional duty, paired with proper courtesy and respect for the judge’s office, is the proper basis for relations between bench and bar. The Court found that Bunyi’s actions ran afoul of these precepts.</p>
</details>

## How did the Court relate the old canon to the new Code of Professional Responsibility?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court noted that although Canon No. 3 of the older Canons of Professional Ethics governed the time when Bunyi committed the acts, the principles were carried forward in the new Code of Professional Responsibility promulgated in 1988. Specifically, the Court cited Canon 13 of the new Code, which states that a lawyer shall rely upon the merits of his cause and refrain from any impropriety that tends to influence or gives the appearance of influencing the court, and Rule 13.01, which prohibits a lawyer from extending extraordinary attention or hospitality to judges or seeking opportunities to cultivate familiarity with them. By invoking the new Code, the Court illustrated the continuity of ethical rules forbidding attempts to influence the judiciary and reinforced its conclusion that Bunyi's conduct violated enduring professional norms.</p>
</details>

## What reasoning did the Court give for proceeding with the case despite the complainant's withdrawal and loss of originals?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court agreed with the Solicitor General that determination of the merits should proceed even after the complainant's withdrawal because the respondent himself admitted the key facts: he acknowledged preparing the draft decisions and the existence of the letters. Thus, the withdrawal and the complainant's inability to produce original letters were immaterial; Bunyi’s admissions supplied the evidentiary basis necessary for the Court to decide whether his conduct violated ethical canons. In disciplinary proceedings, the bar is enforcing public standards and the public interest in maintaining the integrity of the profession and the judiciary does not depend solely on a private complainant’s persistence; therefore, the Court properly continued with its adjudication.</p>
</details>

## Did the Court find any mitigating circumstances in Bunyi’s conduct?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court acknowledged certain aspects of Bunyi’s explanation that could be seen as mitigating: that the judge was overburdened (sitting in two salas), that Bunyi characterized his drafts as subject to the judge’s modification, and that he apologized for any impropriety and expressed contrition. However, the Court considered these factors insufficient to absolve him of ethical breach. The absence of evidence of bribery or corrupt consideration may have tempered the severity of the sanction compared to the most egregious conduct, but the Court nonetheless concluded that the conduct itself—preparing drafts and arranging covert delivery via an interested party—was serious enough to merit a one-year suspension. The Court did not heavily emphasize mitigation in reducing the penalty beyond this sanction but did accept Bunyi’s apology as part of the overall assessment.</p>
</details>

## Why is the independence of the judiciary highlighted in the Court’s decision?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The independence of the judiciary is a foundational principle of the legal system that ensures judges decide cases impartially, based on the law and evidence, free from improper influence by parties, counsel, or other extrajudicial pressures. The Court highlighted judicial independence because Bunyi’s actions—preparing draft judgments and arranging for their private delivery through a party's agent—posed a risk to that independence or at least gave an appearance of undermining it. Even absent direct proof of corruption, private arrangements and the active involvement of counsel in producing judicial instruments outside open court procedures threaten public confidence in impartial adjudication. The Court thus emphasized the need for lawyers, as officers of the court, to avoid conduct that might compromise or appear to compromise judicial independence.</p>
</details>

## How does private communication with a judge about a pending cause violate professional duties?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Private communications with a judge concerning the merits of a pending cause bypass procedural safeguards and the adversarial process that help ensure fairness and transparency. Such communications can afford a party special access to the judge, create an opportunity for undue influence, and erode public confidence in impartial adjudication. The professional duty of a lawyer includes preserving the integrity of the judicial process; by privately communicating about a pending matter or attempting to secure special consideration, a lawyer violates ethical rules designed to maintain equal access to the bench, avoid favoritism, and ensure rulings are based only on admissible evidence and legal argument presented in open court. The Canons and the Code therefore forbid private argument on the merits and any device to gain special personal favor from a judge.</p>
</details>

## What does the Court mean by "appearance of impropriety," and why is it significant?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>"Appearance of impropriety" refers to conduct that, even if not corrupt in fact, creates a reasonable perception that professional standards may have been compromised. The Court treats this as significant because maintaining public confidence in the legal system depends not only on the absence of actual unethical behavior but also on avoiding situations that reasonably look improper. A lawyer must guard against actions that will give rise to such perceptions—like preparing a judge’s decision and orchestrating its delivery through an interested party—because those actions can damage the reputation of the court and the bar, foster suspicion of favoritism, and thus undermine the legitimacy of judicial outcomes. The Court therefore disciplines conduct that gives rise to such an appearance to preserve the integrity of the profession and the judiciary.</p>
</details>

## How did the Court distinguish appropriate assistance to an overburdened judge from the misconduct found here?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court acknowledged that assistance to an overburdened judge—such as helping to draft judgments—could be legitimate if done transparently and with the judge’s full awareness and within appropriate procedures. The misconduct in this case stemmed from the manner in which drafts were prepared and delivered: drafts were prepared by counsel and arranged to be transmitted through a party’s agent with instructions suggesting concealment ("as if you have no knowledge"), rather than through formal, open, and court-sanctioned channels. The Court found that even if the judge appreciated the help, the lack of transparency, the use of an interested intermediary, and the private nature of the communications made the assistance improper. Proper assistance would not entail private, surreptitious dealings that could be perceived as giving counsel undue influence.</p>
</details>

## What role did the earlier case Artiaga, Jr. vs. Villanueva play in the Court's reasoning?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court cited Artiaga, Jr. v. Villanueva (163 SCRA 638, July 29, 1988) as an example of a prior disciplinary decision involving unethical practices by an attorney, where Atty. Enrique C. Villanueva was found guilty of several unethical acts and suspended indefinitely. The citation appears to situate the present case within the Court’s broader jurisprudence on disciplining lawyers for conduct that undermines the integrity of the courts and legal profession. While the Artiaga case involved multiple and more serious transgressions (including causing perjury), the citation underscores the Court’s consistency in imposing sanctions for conduct unbecoming of lawyers. The present case used Artiaga primarily as precedent indicating the Court's willingness to impose strict disciplinary measures where lawyers’ conduct threatened the proper functioning of the legal process.</p>
</details>

## In the Court's view, does intent to assist the court mitigate ethical culpability?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court recognized that Bunyi professed a desire to assist an overworked judge and that his drafts were presented as efforts to expedite disposition. However, the Court did not find that claimed intent sufficient to mitigate ethical culpability because the manner in which the assistance was rendered—private preparation by counsel, covert transmission through a party’s agent, and instructions suggesting secrecy—created an unacceptable risk of undue influence or the appearance thereof. Intent to assist the court may be a relevant factor in mitigation, but it does not excuse procedures that violate standards of transparency and fairness required for maintaining judicial independence. Therefore, while the Court may have taken Bunyi's stated motive into account, it did not absolve him of responsibility.</p>
</details>

## Could the disciplinary outcome have differed if Judge Galicia had publicly requested assistance and accepted a draft in open court? Why or why not?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The record suggests that transparency would have materially altered the ethical assessment. If Judge Galicia had publicly, on the record, requested assistance and formally accepted a draft in open court or through established court channels, the concern about private communication and appearance of impropriety would have been reduced or eliminated. The problem in this case was not only that drafts were prepared, but that their delivery was orchestrated through an interested intermediary with an instruction that suggested concealment. A public, court-sanctioned request and formal acceptance would have complied more closely with the principles of procedural fairness and judicial independence, and likely would have mitigated or removed the inference of attempted influence. However, the Court’s finding is specific to the facts shown—private preparations and clandestine delivery—so a different factual posture could have led to a different outcome.</p>
</details>

## What specific disciplinary measure did the Solicitor General recommend and did the Court adopt it?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Solicitor General recommended that respondent Atty. Bunyi be suspended from the practice of law for one year. The Supreme Court agreed with this recommendation and imposed exactly that sanction: a one-year suspension from the practice of law, effective from the date of notice of the decision. Thus, the Court adopted the Solicitor General’s proposed penalty.</p>
</details>

## What administrative actions did the Court order following the suspension?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Beyond suspending Bunyi for one year, the Court ordered that the decision be entered in the bar records of the respondent. The Court also directed the Court Administrator to inform the different courts of the suspension. These administrative steps are intended to ensure that the suspension is enforced across the judiciary and recorded in official bar records so that Bunyi is prevented from practicing during the suspension and the public record reflects the disciplinary action.</p>
</details>

## How should lawyers conduct themselves when assisting a judge to avoid ethical violations illustrated by this case?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>To avoid ethical violations, lawyers must be cautious about any ex parte or private communications with judges regarding pending matters and should rely on established court procedures when offering assistance. If a judge requests assistance, the interaction should be transparent, placed on the record when possible, and not involve intermediaries who are parties or agents of parties with interest in the case. Lawyers should avoid any steps that create special access or the appearance of favoritism, including covert delivery of drafts through interested parties. When in doubt, counsel should seek to communicate through formal filings, motions, or court-approved channels and ensure that opposing parties and the court are properly informed. The duty to preserve judicial independence and avoid the appearance of impropriety must guide all actions that touch on the court’s adjudicative function.</p>
</details>

## Did Bunyi express remorse or change in conduct, and how did the Court view that?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Respondent Bunyi offered an apology to the Court for any improprieties that may have resulted from his preparation of the draft decisions and manifested that he would be more careful in the future in observing his duties as a lawyer and upholding professional ethics. The Court acknowledged his apology and contrition, and these expressions may have contributed to the decision to impose a finite suspension rather than a harsher penalty. Nonetheless, the Court found that the seriousness of the ethical breach required formal disciplinary action despite remorse, to protect the integrity of the judiciary and deter similar conduct by other lawyers.</p>
</details>

## Would the result have been different if the defendants had not been in default? Explain based on the record.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The record centers on the fact that the defendants had been declared in default and therefore judgments were expected. This setting likely made the drafting of decisions more routine in the parties' view. However, whether defendants were in default is not the dispositive ethical factor; the misconduct identified by the Court was the private preparation and clandestine transmission of draft decisions by counsel through a party’s agent to the judge. Even if the defendants had been present and litigated, private drafting and secret delivery of judicial determinations by counsel would remain problematic because it still entails private communication and potential influence on the judge. Thus, while default made the practical need for judgment more pressing, the unethical element in the conduct was independent of default status, and therefore the result likely would not have been substantively different on the ethical issue alone.</p>
</details>

## What lessons about the relationship between bench and bar does this case teach?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>This case teaches that the relationship between bench and bar must be grounded in independence, transparency, and propriety. Lawyers are officers of the court with duties not only to their clients but also to the judicial system; they must avoid actions that create even an appearance of attempting to secure special treatment or influence judicial determinations. Respectful and courteous relations are proper, but marked attention, secretive conduct, or fostering undue familiarity with judges are forbidden. The case underscores the importance of using official channels, maintaining clear boundaries, and protecting public confidence by avoiding practices that could be construed as compromising fairness or impartiality.</p>
</details>

## How did the Court balance public interest and the respondent's professional status in reaching its decision?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The Court balanced the need to protect the public interest and preserve judicial integrity against the individual respondent’s status by imposing a sanction proportionate to the ethical breach. The Court recognized Bunyi’s admissions and apology and the absence of proof of bribery, but it also emphasized that the public interest in maintaining an independent and impartial judiciary demanded disciplinary action. By suspending Bunyi for one year rather than imposing the most severe penalties, the Court sought to express the gravity of the offense, deter similar conduct by other members of the bar, and yet allow for rehabilitation given mitigating circumstances such as remorse. This balancing reflects the Court’s dual role in disciplining to protect the public and uphold professional standards while proportionally calibrating sanctions to the respondent’s culpability.</p>
</details>

## If you were answering orally in class, how would you concisely state the ratio decidendi of this case?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>The ratio decidendi is that a lawyer’s preparation of draft judicial decisions and arranging their private transmission to a trial judge through an interested party constitutes conduct unbecoming a lawyer and an attempt to influence the court in violation of Canon No. 3 (and later Canon 13/Rule 13.01), warranting disciplinary suspension, even in the absence of proof of bribery, because such conduct undermines judicial independence and gives the appearance of impropriety.</p>
</details>

## Formulate three probing questions that a professor might ask to test deeper understanding of this case and provide strong answers to them.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>Question 1: Could respondent have prepared the drafts without ethical fault if he had forwarded them directly to the judge's office with copies to opposing counsel and entered a formal motion to the court?  
Answer: Yes, the ethical problem in this case was primarily the private method and clandestine transmission through an interested intermediary. If Bunyi had prepared drafts pursuant to a court's explicit authorization or had filed them formally with the court, providing copies to opposing counsel and ensuring the action was on the public record, the appearance of impropriety would have been lessened or eliminated. The key is transparency and adherence to procedural norms that protect fairness and impartiality. Absent secretive conduct or private communications outside the record, preparing a draft at a judge’s request, especially with the knowledge and consent of the court and the parties, may be permissible and helpful to judicial efficiency.  
<br><br>Question 2: Why is the Court concerned with "appearance" and not only with proven corruption?  
Answer: The judiciary’s legitimacy depends not only on the absence of actual corruption but also on public confidence that courts operate impartially and fairly. The appearance of impropriety can erode that confidence and thereby harm the administration of justice. Since attorneys are officers of the court entrusted to uphold the system, they must avoid conduct that reasonably appears to compromise judicial impartiality. Thus, disciplinary rules cover both actual improper acts and acts that create the appearance of impropriety to preserve trust in the legal system.  
<br><br>Question 3: How does the admission by the respondent shape the Court’s decision-making in disciplinary proceedings?  
Answer: The respondent’s admission that he prepared the drafts and that the letters existed supplied the essential factual predicate for determining whether ethical rules were violated, rendering the complainant’s withdrawal and the loss of original documents irrelevant. In disciplinary proceedings, admissions by the respondent streamline proof, allow the Court to assess intent and context, and enable the imposition of sanctions based on established facts. Admissions also limit defenses and can be seen as mitigating insofar as they reflect contrition, but they do not preclude discipline where the admitted conduct contravenes professional standards.</p>
</details>

## Conclude with practical advice for a law student on how to avoid the ethical pitfalls illustrated by this case.

<details>

<p>Practical advice: Always prioritize transparency and the formal record when interacting with judges about pending matters. Avoid private communications with a judge about the merits of a case, do not use intermediaries—especially interested parties—to convey substantive materials or messages to the court, and refrain from actions that may give even the appearance of special access or favoritism. If a judge requests assistance, seek to have that request made on the record or handled through formal court procedures, and ensure opposing counsel is informed as appropriate. Keep professional boundaries, respect the independence of the judiciary, and remember that ethical lapses can result in suspension or other sanctions regardless of whether corrupt payments or explicit favors are proven.</p>
