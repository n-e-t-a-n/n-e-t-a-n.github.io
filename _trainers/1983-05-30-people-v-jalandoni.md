<p>
This case was decided by the Supreme Court (Second Division) of the Philippines, reported as G.R. No. L-57555, with the decision dated May 30, 1983. The matter came to the Supreme Court on appeal from a judgment of the defunct Circuit Criminal Court of Manila that had found the accused, Teresa L. Jalandoni, guilty of estafa under Article 315, paragraph 2(a) of the Revised Penal Code and had sentenced her to reclusion perpetua and ordered indemnification of the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) in the sum of P1,600,000.00. On appeal, the Supreme Court reviewed the trial record, the testimonies, the admitted facts, and the evidence presented by both sides before rendering its decision to set aside the conviction and acquit the accused. The decision is therefore a definitive appellate disposition overturning the conviction imposed by the trial court.

## What specific offense was charged against Teresa Jalandoni in the information, and under what statutory provision was she convicted at trial?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The information filed in the Circuit Criminal Court charged Teresa L. Jalandoni with the crime of estafa. The trial court found her guilty under Article 315, paragraph 2(a) of the Revised Penal Code. The trial court's judgment, as reflected in the record, specifically states that the accused was "guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of estafa defined under Article 315, 2(a)," and imposed the penalty of reclusion perpetua, along with an order to indemnify the Bank of the Philippine Islands in the sum of P1,600,000.00 and to pay costs. Thus, the charge was estafa, and the statutory basis cited by the trial court was Article 315(2)(a) of the Revised Penal Code.

<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The information alleged that on or about and during the period September 8, 9 and 10, 1976, in Manila, the accused Teresa Jalandoni, with intent to defraud and by grave abuse of the confidence reposed in her by the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), engaged in fraudulent acts and false pretenses. Specifically, the information alleged that she used a current account she had opened with the Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC), Greenhills Branch, account No. 6-06061, and issued nine personal checks payable to cash against that account. The checks and amounts alleged in the information were RCBC Nos. 2424526 (P300,000.00), 2424527 (P200,000.00), 2424528 (P250,000.00), 2424529 (P300,000.00), 2424530 (P200,000.00), 2424531 (P150,000.00), 2424532 (P300,000.00), 2424533 (P200,000.00), and 2424534 (P250,000.00), totaling P2,150,000.00. The allegation continued that she deposited those checks into her current account No. 2274-11 (sometimes referred to in the record as No. 2274-1) at the BPI Plaza Cervantes Branch, but that she knew she did not have sufficient funds to cover them. Before the deposited checks could be collected and cleared by RCBC (the drawee bank), she allegedly made false statements and fraudulent representations to the BPI Plaza Cervantes Branch manager that the deposited checks were good and covered with sufficient funds, thereby inducing the bank to honor checks drawn by her against the deposited items in the aggregate amount of P2,041,780.00. When the deposited RCBC checks were presented to the drawee bank, all except RCBC No. 2424530 (P200,000.00) were dishonored for lack of funds, and she allegedly failed to make good the deficit despite due notice, to the prejudice of BPI in at least the sum of P1,391,780.00. These were the essential allegations of the information submitted to and tried by the trial court.

## Identify the bank accounts and the parties on those accounts that are central to the transactions in this case.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
Two bank accounts are central to the transactions. First, Teresa Jalandoni (initially with her spouse H. M. Jalandoni) opened a joint current account with the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), Plaza Cervantes Branch, assigned current account No. 2274-1 (sometimes noted as 2274-11 in the information). That joint account was opened on July 30, 1962 by the spouses H. M. Jalandoni and Teresa L. Jalandoni. After the death of H. M. Jalandoni, the daughter Maria Teresa Macapagal replaced her father as co-owner on November 22, 1973, so the account appears in the names of Teresa L. Jalandoni and/or Maria Teresa J. Macapagal thereafter.

The second account is Teresa Jalandoni’s current account with the Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC), Greenhills Branch, which was assigned account No. 6-06061. It was against this RCBC account that the nine personal checks payable to cash were drawn and from which these checks were deposited into the BPI account. Therefore, the RCBC account served as the source of the deposited checks, and the BPI account was the depository account into which those checks were placed and from which checks to third parties were honored on the strength of those deposited items.

## Summarize the People’s factual narrative of what happened on September 8–10, 1976.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
According to the People's narrative in the record, the events unfolded over three days. On September 8, 1976, the accused drew three checks on her RCBC account (No. 6-06061) totalling P750,000.00, all payable to cash, and deposited them into her BPI account No. 2274-1 at the Plaza Cervantes Branch. Prior to or contemporaneous with that deposit, she purportedly issued 25 checks drawn on the BPI account amounting to P745,980.00 in favor of other parties; those checks were honored and paid by BPI on her assurances to the bank manager that the RCBC checks she had deposited were funded. At her request, the bank returned to her eleven other checks drawn on her BPI account.

On September 9, 1976, the same pattern recurred: she drew three more RCBC checks totalling P650,000.00, payable to cash, and deposited them into her BPI account; she also issued 26 BPI checks totalling P639,700.00 that were honored on the date of deposit on the same assurance. The bank again returned other checks to her at her request.

On September 10, 1976, a third batch of three RCBC checks totalling P750,000.00, payable to cash, were deposited into BPI; 22 checks drawn against the BPI account totalling P656,100.00 were honored on the strength of the deposited RCBC checks on her assurance they were funded. When the deposited RCBC checks were presented to the drawee RCBC for payment, all of them except RCBC No. 2424530 (P200,000.00) were dishonored for lack of sufficient funds. The People alleged that she knew the checks lacked funds and nonetheless induced BPI to honor the checks drawn against those deposits, causing damage to BPI when the RCBC checks were dishonored.

## What admissions did the appellant make in her brief and in the record?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The appellant expressly admitted several material facts; these admissions were relied upon and acknowledged in the record. Specifically, the appellant admitted that (a) she issued nine RCBC personal checks; (b) the total face value of those nine checks was P2,150,000.00; (c) of those nine checks, one — RCBC check No. 2424530 — in the amount of P200,000.00, was honored when presented through clearing; (d) checks drawn by the appellant against those deposited personal checks (i.e., checks payable from her BPI account drawn on the strength of those deposits) aggregated P2,041,780.00; (e) those checks were drawn in favor of third parties and not in favor of the appellant herself; and (f) out of the P2,150,000.00 face value of the nine RCBC checks, the damage suffered by the bank was P1,391,780.00 (this being the figure asserted by the prosecution in one part of the pleadings, though the trial court ordered P1,600,000.00 indemnity). These admissions show that the appellant did not challenge the occurrence of the transactions themselves or the basic numerical facts, but rather contested the legal characterization — particularly the presence of criminal intent to defraud.
</p>
</details>

## What was the appellant’s principal defense, and how did she characterize her conduct?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The appellant’s principal defense was that she had been previously granted an overdraft (OD) or drawn against uncollected deposit (DAUD) privileges by the BPI Plaza Cervantes Branch and that her conduct must be understood against the background of those established banking practices. She contended that the bank had a practice of honoring checks drawn against uncollected deposit items for long‑standing, creditworthy depositors, and that she had been such a depositor with a credit standing that allowed the bank to extend those facilities. Accordingly, her assertion was that she had not intended to defraud the bank; rather, she relied on the bank’s established practice to permit checks to be honored against uncollected deposits. In other words, she argued that the bank’s honoring of checks against deposited but uncollected RCBC checks was a banking accommodation previously extended to her, and that she did not act with criminal intent to swindle the bank.

## Describe Manager Manuel L. Garcia’s testimony and explain its relevance to the defense.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
Manager Manuel L. Garcia, who was the manager of BPI’s Plaza Cervantes Branch at the time of the transactions, testified that the checks in question were honored by the bank because the depositor — Teresa Jalandoni — had been a depositor of long standing and the bank considered her to have a good credit standing. Garcia stated, in response to defense counsel’s questions, that the bank allowed the practice of honoring checks drawn against uncollected deposits only when the check depositor had a good credit standing with the bank. Thus, his testimony established that there was a routine banking accommodation for depositors with demonstrated creditworthiness: the bank would permit immediate withdrawal/advances against items that were not yet cleared (DAUD or OD) in reliance on the depositor’s standing.

This testimony is directly relevant to the defense because it supports the appellant’s claim that her transactions were within the course of established practice at that branch and were not the product of false pretenses or a scheme to defraud. If the bank’s practiced policy was to allow such accommodation to long‑standing depositors, the extension of such accommodation to the appellant under those conditions tends to negate the inference of criminal intent; rather than a deception engineered by the depositor, the honoring of checks can be explained as a banking accommodation predicated on the depositor’s credit standing. Garcia’s testimony supplies a factual foundation for that explanation.

## Summarize the testimony of Eriberto M. Ignacio and its import in this case.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
Eriberto M. Ignacio, who succeeded Garcia as manager of the Plaza Cervantes branch in November 1976, was called as a defense witness and provided detailed testimony regarding the bank statements, the manner of posting deposits and checks, the meaning of the abbreviation "JE" (journal entry), the process by which check deposits were cleared, and the notation of "OD" (overdraft) as a subtotal in the statements. Ignacio explained that entries followed a consistent method: deposits marked "JE" were check deposits (i.e., not cash immediately available), and ordinarily three days were required for checks to clear. He detailed how a subtotal overdraft was arrived at when posted checks exceeded the existing cash balance, and he identified specific overdraft figures as of various dates, including a sizeable overdraft balance as of August 9, 1976, and subsequent reductions by check deposits of P300,000.00 at later dates.

Ignacio’s testimony is significant because it provided documentary and operational context showing that the account in question consistently reflected overdrawn subtotals and that the bank’s posting practice accommodated checks that were not yet cleared. This testimony reinforced the defense argument that the bank extended overdraft/DAUD privileges to the account, and that the actions taken on September 8–10, 1976, had to be viewed in light of this established practice. By explaining the entries and the timing of clearings, Ignacio’s testimony undercut a straightforward inference that the appellant’s deposits and withdrawals were an immediate and overt fraudulent scheme, and instead presented them as part of an established banking routine to which the appellant was entitled.

## What was the trial court’s verdict and sentence against the appellant?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The trial court found Teresa Jalandoni guilty beyond reasonable doubt of estafa under Article 315(2)(a) and sentenced her to reclusion perpetua. In addition to the imprisonment sentence, the trial court ordered the appellant to indemnify the Bank of the Philippine Islands, Plaza Cervantes Branch, in the sum of P1,600,000.00, representing the balance which the court considered she swindled, and to pay the costs. This judgment reflected the trial court’s conclusion that the appellant had committed the crime of estafa by inducing the bank to honor certain checks on the basis of false pretenses concerning the sufficiency and collectability of the deposited RCBC checks.
</p>
</details>

## How did the Supreme Court (majority) resolve the appeal and what was the ultimate disposition?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Supreme Court, in the majority decision, set aside the conviction rendered by the trial court and entered a judgment acquitting Teresa Jalandoni of the charge of estafa. The Court concluded that the prosecution had failed to prove the appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The majority’s reasoning rested on the evidentiary showing that the appellant had been accorded overdraft or drawn-against-uncollected-deposits (DAUD) privileges by the bank, testimony from bank managers corroborating the practice of honoring checks for depositors of good credit standing, the fact that the branch manager who extended such accommodation was not charged as a co-principal and had retired, and other circumstances such as the honoring of one of the deposited RCBC checks, the fact that checks drawn on the strength of the deposits were paid to third parties rather than for the appellant’s direct appropriation, and the appellant’s subsequent efforts to reduce the bank’s resulting deficit through mortgages and the transfer of jewelry in an attempt to make good on obligations. Based on these combined factors, the majority found reasonable doubt as to criminal intent and thus acquitted the appellant. No costs were imposed.
</p>
</details>

## What specific factors did the majority cite as undermining a finding of criminal intent ("fraud") by the appellant?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The majority identified multiple factors that, taken together, undermined a conclusion that the appellant acted with the requisite criminal intent to defraud. First, the appellant had been afforded overdraft (OD) or drawn-against-uncollected-deposits (DAUD) privileges over a series of past transactions, and testimony by branch managers indicated that the bank honored checks against uncollected deposits for depositors of long standing and good credit standing. Second, the branch manager who facilitated these accommodations was not accused as a co‑principal in the crime and had been allowed to retire, suggesting no clear evidence of collusion or active criminal participation by bank personnel. Third, one of the nine RCBC checks (No. 2424530 for P200,000.00) was honored, which the majority regarded as inconsistent with a plan to appropriate the full value of the checks. Fourth, the checks drawn against the deposited items were issued in favor of third parties, not the appellant herself, which the majority treated as an indicium that appellant did not intend to abscond with the funds. Fifth, the appellant undertook steps to reduce the bank’s deficit—she mortgaged property of her son for P250,000.00 which was applied to one dishonored check and gave jewelry worth P300,000.00 to the bank president as a token of sincerity—factors that tend to demonstrate intent to make good on obligations rather than to steal. Finally, the appellant reduced the outstanding balance owed to the bank, further undermining the notion that she planned to appropriate the full P2,150,000.00. Collectively, these considerations convinced the majority that guilt had not been proven beyond reasonable doubt.
</p>
</details>

## How did the absence of a charge against Branch Manager Manuel L. Garcia influence the Court’s analysis?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The majority treated the absence of any criminal charge against Branch Manager Manuel L. Garcia as a significant circumstance. The Court reasoned that if the appellant had, in fact, carried out a deliberate and fraudulent scheme to induce the bank to honor checks, she could not plausibly have done so without the active cooperation of the manager who had operational control over the honors. Manager Garcia was the officer who testified that the bank honored checks against uncollected deposits for depositors with good credit standing. Because Garcia was not accused as a co‑principal and was permitted to retire, the majority inferred that there was no persuasive evidence showing that he had engaged in criminal collusion with the appellant. This, in turn, diminished the credibility of the prosecution’s claim that appellant executed a deceptive scheme that relied on the manager’s wrongful cooperation; absent evidence implicating him, the Court was reluctant to conclude that appellant alone orchestrated a fraud sufficient to sustain a conviction. Thus, Garcia’s non-prosecution was used by the majority as a factor suggesting that the transactions were facilitated by normal banking practices rather than by criminal conspiracy.
</p>
</details>

## How did the majority view the fact that one of the nine deposited RCBC checks was honored?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The majority considered the honoring of one RCBC check — No. 2424530 for P200,000.00 — as inconsistent with the existence of a premeditated scheme to defraud. The Court observed that if the appellant had the forethought and intent to defraud, she would not have arranged for any of the deposited checks to be honored and collected; instead, she would have sought to appropriate the full benefit of the deposited items. The fact that one check was honored, therefore, was presented by the majority as evidence that undermined the prosecution’s narrative of deliberate fraud. The majority viewed this as indicative that either the appellant expected the deposits to clear, or she did not intend to appropriate the entire proceeds in a criminal manner, and thus it contributed to reasonable doubt as to the necessary criminal intent.
</p>
</details>

## Explain how the issuance of checks in favor of third parties, rather than to the appellant herself, factored into the Court’s reasoning.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Court noted that the checks drawn on the BPI account and honored by the bank — the checks that were drawn against the deposited RCBC checks — were drawn in favor of other parties and not in favor of the appellant herself. The majority interpreted this as a point that militated against the typical pattern of self-enrichment one expects in a scheme to defraud: when a person intends to steal or convert property, they often divert the proceeds directly to themselves. Instead, the appellant’s issuance of checks payable to third parties suggested that she was using the deposited items to liquidate or pay obligations to others, which could be consistent with ordinary banking transactions or with credit and liquidity management, especially when OD/DAUD privileges existed. Thus, this fact was afforded weight by the majority as further evidence that criminal intent — an intent to convert bank funds to her own use by deception — was not conclusively established.
</p>
</details>

## What proofs did the appellant present to show attempts to make good the bank’s losses, and how did the Court consider them?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The appellant produced evidence that she took concrete steps to reduce the bank’s exposure after the RCBC checks were dishonored. She mortgaged a lot belonging to her son, with his authority, to the bank for a loan of P250,000.00; this amount was applied to one of the dishonored checks. The record includes documentary exhibits supporting this transaction: Exhibit 37 (promissory note signed by the son), Exhibit 37‑a (crime estate mortgage), Exhibit 37‑b (Transfer Certificate of Title No. T‑71084), Exhibit 37‑c (Special Power of Attorney), and Exhibit 38 (check for P250,000.00). In addition, the appellant gave jewelry worth P300,000.00 to the bank president, Mr. Alberto F. de Villa‑Abrifle, which she described as a token of her sincerity to pay.

The Court considered these acts as important indicia that the appellant did not intend to permanently deprive the bank of its funds. The majority regarded the mortgage and the transfer of jewelry as efforts to make restitution or otherwise reduce the bank’s loss, which was inconsistent with an unambiguous intent to defraud. These remedial efforts contributed to the Court’s conclusion that there was reasonable doubt regarding the criminal intent element, and thus supported the conclusion that the prosecution did not carry its burden of proving estafa beyond reasonable doubt.

</details>

## What was the numerical discrepancy between the face value of the RCBC checks, the amount of checks drawn against them, and the damage alleged? How did the parties present these figures?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The face value of the nine RCBC checks admitted by the appellant totaled P2,150,000.00. One of those nine checks (No. 2424530) for P200,000.00 was honored, leaving an initial unpaid face amount of P1,950,000.00. Checks drawn against those deposited items and honored by BPI aggregated P2,041,780.00 according to admissions in the record. The People alleged damage to BPI of at least P1,391,780.00 in the information; however, the trial court ordered indemnification of P1,600,000.00 in its judgment. The appellant contended that the damage suffered by the bank had been reduced to P1,391,780.00, and further pointed to the P250,000.00 applied from the mortgage loan and the P300,000.00 worth of jewelry as additional offsets or evidencing her willingness to make recompense. Thus, between these various figures there were discrepancies: face value of checks was P2,150,000.00, amount of checks drawn against them and honored was P2,041,780.00, and the alleged damage ranged from P1,391,780.00 (as claimed at one point) to P1,600,000.00 (as ordered by the trial court). The Supreme Court took these numerical facts into account in assessing whether the prosecution had established the essential element of fraud beyond reasonable doubt.

## What reasoning did Justice Makasiar (dissenting) give for affirming the conviction?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
Justice Makasiar, in his dissenting opinion, argued that the conviction should be affirmed. He maintained that it was amply proven that the personal checks drawn by the appellant and deposited in BPI were honored because of active false pretenses and fraudulent representations made by the appellant to the branch manager — specifically, that the deposited personal RCBC checks were good and covered with sufficient funds when they were not. The dissent emphasized that the checks, when presented to the drawee bank, were dishonored because the appellant lacked sufficient funds, and that despite this, the appellant had induced the bank to honor checks drawn on the basis of those deposits. Thus, Justice Makasiar concluded that the elements of estafa — the deceit and inducement of the bank to disburse funds on false pretenses — were established by the evidence and that the trial court’s conviction should be sustained. The dissent, therefore, focused on the content of the alleged misrepresentations and the dishonor of the checks upon presentment as sufficient proof of fraud.
</p>
</details>

## How did the Supreme Court apply the standard of proof in criminal cases to the facts here?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Supreme Court applied the criminal law standard that guilt must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. Assessing the entirety of the record, the Court determined that the prosecution had not carried its burden to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had the criminal intent required for estafa. The majority weighed the evidence — admissions, bank manager testimony about customary OD/DAUD practice, detailed explanatory testimony from the subsequent manager about deposits and clearing, the fact the branch manager was not charged, the honoring of one deposited check, the issuance of checks to third parties, and the appellant’s post‑event efforts to make restitution — and found that these combined circumstances gave rise to reasonable doubt about whether the transactions were the product of fraudulent intent. Because criminal conviction requires that such intent be proved without reasonable doubt, the Court concluded the prosecution failed and the accused should be acquitted.

## From the record, explain how the bank determined whether a check deposit had been cleared or returned.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
According to the testimony of Eriberto M. Ignacio, a bank officer who handled the accountings, a deposited check marked with "JE" on the bank statement indicated a journal entry signifying a check deposit rather than a cash deposit. To determine whether a check deposit had been cleared, one would look to see whether, after the customary clearing time (which Ignacio testified, based on experience, is ordinarily about three days), there was a corresponding debit entry reflecting that the deposited check had been returned or charged back. If, after the clearing period, there was no debit entry indicating the deposit was returned, the presumption was that the check deposit had cleared. In short, a lack of a later debit account after the customary clearing period indicated the deposit had not been returned and was considered cleared; conversely, if a debit showed up, that would reflect the return or dishonor of the deposit. Ignacio’s explanation provided a working operational method used by the bank to ascertain the status of deposited checks.
</p>
</details>

## On what dates did testimony cited in the record occur, and why is that relevant?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The record cites testimony on several dates. Manager Manuel L. Garcia testified on July 19, 1979, providing the bank practice background that the bank honored checks for long-standing depositors in whom it had confidence. Eriberto M. Ignacio testified earlier on February 18, 1980, and later testimony by him appears in the transcript of October 2, 1980. These dates are relevant because they establish the timeline of the adjudicative process — namely, that the evidence about bank practices and the account’s status was developed years after the transactions of September 1976. They also show continuity in testimony by persons who had direct knowledge of the branch's practices during the period in question, strengthening the evidentiary link between the appellant’s transactions and the bank’s customary accommodations. Additionally, other procedural notices indicate that on January 12, 1983 the Court was informed of Garcia’s retirement; this administrative fact was woven into the Court’s reasoning, as the majority noted that Garcia was not charged and had been allowed to retire. The dates thus reflect the temporal unfolding of the litigation and the availability and status of witnesses whose testimony was material to resolving the core factual dispute.

</details>

## Discuss how the bank statement exhibits and the OD notations were used in defense testimony.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The defense introduced xerox copies of monthly bank statements (marked as Exhibits 1 to 32 and other submarked pieces) to demonstrate the pattern of overdrafts and the manner in which check deposits were posted and cleared. Ignacio was shown these exhibits and explained the columns: the check numbers, check amounts, deposits, dates, and the balance columns. He pointed out that deposits marked "JE" were check deposits and that balances bracketed and annotated with "OD" indicated subtotal overdrafts as of specific dates. He explained the mechanics by which posted checks could create a subtotal overdraft where the sum of checks posted on a date exceeded the then available cash balance. Ignacio identified large overdraft figures at various points in time, such as an overdraft of P1,083,740.48 and P1,178,980.48 as of August 9, 1976, and how further check deposits of P300,000.00 reduced such debits even while the deposits remained uncollected.

This documentary explanation was used by the defense to show that the account routinely operated with overdrafts created by posted checks and that the bank treated certain check deposits as available for purposes of honoring checks despite their not yet being cleared — i.e., the DAUD/OD accommodation. The exhibits and Ignacio’s interpretation thereby substantiated the defense’s thesis that the bank’s honors on September 8–10, 1976 were extensions of an established banking practice applied to a depositor with a demonstrated pattern of such transactions, rather than the product of deceitful misrepresentations by the appellant.
</p>
</details>

## Explain the significance of the journal entry abbreviation "JE" as explained by Ignacio.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
Ignacio explained that the abbreviation "JE" appearing after deposit entries on the bank statements stood for "Journal Entry," and that it denoted that the deposit was made by check rather than by cash. This distinction is important because a "JE" check deposit is not immediately available as cash; it is subject to the banking clearing process and can be returned if dishonored by the drawee bank. Ignacio also testified that, based on experience, the ordinary clearing time for such checks was approximately three days; thus a check deposited on a certain date and marked "JE" would typically be cleared by the drawee within this period unless it was returned. The presence of "JE" therefore helped explain why certain debits and overdrafts appeared on the statements at particular times and supported the defense narrative that the bank routinely posted uncollected check deposits and sometimes drew against them as part of an overdraft accommodation for depositors with good standing. In sum, "JE" served as a key bookkeeping signal to distinguish types of deposits and their collectability status.
</p>
</details>

## What in the record explains how long ordinary clearing of checks takes and how that applies to the contested transactions?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
Ignacio testified that, in his experience as a bank executive, the ordinary clearing time for checks deposited was about three days, and that out-of-town checks could take longer. He used this standard to explain that a check deposited on January 2, 1974, for example, would be expected to clear by January 5, 1974, if it were a local check. Applying that general clearing period to the contested September 1976 transactions, the testimony suggests that the RCBC checks deposited on September 8, 9 and 10 would ordinarily not have been cleared until a few days after deposit. Thus, BPI’s honoring of checks drawn against those deposits on the same dates (or contemporaneously) would have constituted drawing against uncollected deposits — i.e., DAUD or OD — rather than drawing against funds already collected and indisputably available. This timing element supports the defense argument that the bank’s honoring of checks on those dates followed the established practice of allowing temporary accommodation to depositors and did not necessarily imply appellant’s intent to perpetrate an immediate fraud.
</p>
</details>

## Why did the majority consider the bank’s routine of honoring checks against uncollected deposits important in determining criminal intent?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The majority considered that if the bank had an established and ordinary practice of honoring checks drawn against uncollected deposits for long-standing depositors with good credit, then the appellant’s conduct — depositing RCBC checks and having checks honored against those deposits — could well be explained as part of a routine banking accommodation rather than as an exercise in fraudulent deception. In criminal law, the presence of an innocent explanation that is reasonably consistent with the facts may create reasonable doubt as to the requisite criminal intent. The Court observed that the bank manager’s testimony established precisely such a practice, and the detailed bank statements corroborated the existence of repeated overdraft-like subtotals in the account.

Because intent to defraud is a critical element in estafa, the existence of an institutional practice that would permit the very actions undertaken by the appellant meant that the prosecution had to negate the reasonable inference that the appellant was operating within the bank’s accommodation. The majority therefore treated the bank’s routine as an evidentiary reason that the prosecution’s proof of fraudulent intent was insufficient to exclude reasonable doubt.

## How did the timing and pattern of deposits and issuances from September 8 to 10, 1976 reflect on the contested issue?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The pattern recorded in the People’s version showed that on September 8, 1976, the appellant deposited three RCBC checks totalling P750,000.00 and simultaneously had 25 checks drawn on her BPI account — totalling P745,980.00 — honored by BPI; on September 9, she deposited three more RCBC checks totalling P650,000.00 and had 26 checks totalling P639,700.00 honored; on September 10, she deposited another three RCBC checks totalling P750,000.00 and had 22 checks totalling P656,100.00 honored. This repeating pattern of depositing high‑value RCBC checks payable to cash and having immediately the BPI honor multiple checks drawn on the BPI account suggests a series of liquidity transactions that mirrored the bank’s practice of honoring checks against uncollected deposits for trusted customers. The pattern also demonstrates that the checks honored by BPI were typically made payable to third parties and were in amounts comparable to the deposited items. The Court viewed this pattern, together with the bank’s practices and the testimony, as suggestive that the account was managed under an accommodation arrangement and that the appellant’s transactions on those dates could thus be accounted for by ordinary banking practice rather than by a scheme to defraud. The uniformity and repetition across the three days lent credence, in the majority’s view, to the characterization of the transactions as a continued application of the DAUD/OD facility rather than an immediate fraudulent appropriation.

## Discuss any documentary evidence the appellant relied on to prove mitigation or lack of intent and how the Court treated that evidence.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The appellant relied on documentary evidence demonstrating efforts to reduce the bank’s exposure after the dishonor of the RCBC checks. Key documents included the promissory note signed by her son (Exhibit 37), a crime estate mortgage (Exhibit 37‑a), the Transfer Certificate of Title (Exhibit 37‑b) showing the mortgaged lot, a Special Power of Attorney (Exhibit 37‑c), and a check for P250,000.00 (Exhibit 38) which together evidenced that a loan secured by the son’s property was obtained and the proceeds applied to one of the dishonored checks. Additionally, there was evidence of jewelry valued at P300,000.00 given to the bank president as a token evidencing her intention to make good on obligations.

The Court considered these items significant for two reasons. First, they were concrete acts tending to redress the bank’s loss rather than to conceal or appropriate it; second, they served as objective indicia that the appellant’s conduct lacked the hallmark of an intent permanently to deprive the bank. The majority therefore accepted these documentary acts as part of the totality of circumstances that cast doubt on the prosecution’s claim that she had the mens rea for estafa. The Court treated them not as exculpatory in the abstract but as credible evidence that, when combined with other factual elements (e.g., DAUD practice, manager’s testimony, pattern of transactions), made it impossible to rule out reasonable doubt regarding fraudulent intent.
</p>
</details>

## How did the Court reconcile the appellant’s admissions that she issued the checks and that most were dishonored with its acquittal?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Court recognized that the appellant admitted the factual components of the transactions: she had drawn the nine RCBC checks totaling P2,150,000.00, deposited them in her BPI account, and most of those checks were, in fact, dishonored upon presentment, except for one that cleared. However, the Supreme Court explained that factual admissions about the occurrence of transactions do not ipso facto establish criminal intent. The element that the prosecution needed to prove for estafa — the fraudulent intent or deceit used to induce the bank to part with its funds — remained unmet beyond reasonable doubt in light of the defensive evidence.

Thus, while the appellant admitted the mechanical facts (drawing and depositing checks, dishonor upon presentment), the Court carefully examined the contemporaneous bank practices, manager testimony, the OD/DAUD accommodations afforded to the appellant, the pattern of transactions, the fact that checks were paid to third parties, and the appellant’s post‑event arrangements to reduce the bank’s loss. Weighing all of these together, the Court concluded that the prosecution had not excluded the reasonable explanation that the appellant was acting within an established banking practice and with intent to meet obligations rather than with a premeditated intent to defraud. That assessment allowed the Court to reconcile admissions of factual acts with an acquittal on the criminal charge because the crucial mens rea element remained in reasonable doubt.

## Could the prosecution have relied on any testimony or evidence that unequivocally established fraudulent intent? What does the record show?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The prosecution presented evidence that could be argued to support fraudulent intent: the information alleged, and the appellant admitted, that she issued nine RCBC checks totalling P2,150,000.00 while the drawee bank ultimately dishonored all but one for lack of sufficient funds, and that she had engaged in representations to the bank that the deposited checks were good and would be honored. The People asserted also that these representations induced the bank to honor checks drawn by her in the aggregate amount of P2,041,780.00, and that she failed to make good despite due notice and demand.

However, the record as a whole also contains countervailing testimony and documentary evidence, particularly from the bank managers and the bank statements, which supported a different inference: that the appellant had been extended overdraft-like accommodations by the bank and that this practice explained why the bank honored checks against uncollected items. The absence of criminal charges against the branch manager, Garcia, who participated in honoring the checks and later retired, appeared to undercut an assertion that the honors were procured by deceit alone. The record therefore does not present a single piece of evidence that the majority considered wholly conclusive of fraudulent intent; rather, it contains competing inferences. The dissent would have inferred fraud from the fact of dishonor and the alleged misrepresentations, but the majority found the totality of evidence insufficient to establish mens rea beyond reasonable doubt. In sum, while the prosecution had evidence consistent with fraud, the record also contained credible, contemporaneous, and documentary evidence consistent with innocent explanations, preventing a conclusive finding of fraudulent intent in the majority's view.

## If one adopts the dissenting view, what portions of the record would best support an inference of fraud?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
Adopting the dissenting view, the strongest portions of the record supporting an inference of fraud would be: (1) the fact that the nine RCBC checks deposited by the appellant were largely dishonored upon presentment because the drawer lacked sufficient funds, showing the material falsity of any assertion that the checks were “good”; (2) the People’s allegation that the appellant, before the deposited checks could clear, made representations to the BPI branch manager that the deposited checks were funded and would be honored, and that on the basis of those assurances the bank honored and paid checks amounting to P2,041,780.00; (3) the prosecution’s evidence that the appellant received the proceeds of checks drawn against the deposits — at least insofar as the bank disbursed funds to pay those checks — which were later not coverable when the deposited items were dishonored; and (4) the trial court’s factual finding and conviction, which indicates that at least the trial court found those representations and their causal effect on the bank’s honors persuasive.

Under the dissent’s reasoning, those elements collectively demonstrate the essential components of estafa: a false representation or pretence that induces another to part with property, an actual deprivation (dishonor of checks resulting in bank loss), and knowledge by the accused of the falsity of her representations. The dissent thus would focus on the content and effect of appellant’s statements to the manager and the subsequent dishonor to infer deliberate deceit rather than innocent reliance on a bank facility.

## Identify and explain the legal significance of the Court’s final disposition for the prosecution and for the accused.

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Supreme Court’s final disposition — setting aside the conviction and acquitting the accused — carries distinct legal consequences for both parties. For the prosecution, the decision represents a reversal of the trial court’s findings and a recognition that the evidence did not meet the standard required for conviction (i.e., proof beyond reasonable doubt of criminal intent). The reversal underscores the principle that criminal liability cannot be predicated solely on transactional facts without satisfactorily proving mens rea, particularly where plausible non‑criminal explanations exist.

For the accused, the acquittal restores the presumption of innocence and removes the criminal penalties imposed by the trial court, including the sentence of reclusion perpetua and the indemnity obligation. The Court’s judgment explicitly set aside the trial verdict and entered an acquittal. Practically, it means the accused is absolved of criminal responsibility for the charged estafa based on the record before the Court. The decision also signals that conduct which may have civil or contractual ramifications (such as dishonored checks and bank indebtedness) does not automatically translate into criminal guilt when the requisite criminal state of mind is in reasonable dispute.
</p>
</details>

## From the facts and rulings in this case, what evidentiary burdens must the prosecution meet to sustain a conviction for estafa in similar banking contexts?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
While the Court’s opinion confines itself to the particular record, its analysis emphatically applies the general principle that the prosecution must prove each essential element of estafa beyond reasonable doubt. In a banking context where ordinary practices such as overdraft or DAUD accommodations exist, this requires the prosecution not only to show that checks were issued, deposited, and later dishonored, but also to prove with convincing evidence that the accused knowingly made false representations or engaged in deceit with the deliberate intent to induce the bank to part with funds and that the bank’s honors were proximately caused by those deceptive representations rather than by accepted banking practices or accommodations.

Consequently, in similar cases the prosecution would need to produce strong, direct evidence showing that the depositor understood the checks to be unfunded, intentionally misled bank officers about the funds’ existence or collectability, and did so to effectuate the bank’s payment to the depositor’s own benefit or to others pursuant to a fraudulent design. Absent such proof, the presence of routine bank practices, corroborating testimony from bank personnel that accommodations existed, documentary statements showing customary OD entries, or post‑event restitution efforts by the accused may create reasonable doubt and defeat criminal liability. The burden is high because mens rea is a necessary element and the Courts will not infer it lightly when credible, non‑criminal explanations exist.

## Suppose you are appellate counsel for the People; based on this record, what aspects of the defense evidence would you challenge on appeal?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
As appellate counsel for the People, one would need to focus on undermining the defense narrative that the transactions were ordinary banking accommodations lacking any fraudulent intent. The record provides points for attack: first, emphasize the admissions that the appellant drew nine RCBC checks knowing she lacked sufficient funds — such admissions may be used to argue conscious wrongdoing. Second, highlight the fact that all of the deposited RCBC checks except one were dishonored upon presentment, which supports the People’s assertion that the appellant’s representations to the bank manager were false. Third, question the credibility and sufficiency of the bank managers’ testimony as to standard practice in the face of the concrete result that large sums were disbursed on uncollected and ultimately dishonored items — i.e., press that allowing such large accommodations might have been extraordinary and not an ordinary, routine practice. Fourth, challenge any inference that the return of some checks to the appellant or the issuance of checks to third parties necessarily negates intent to defraud; there are plausible explanations consistent with fraud for payments to third parties (e.g., paying accomplices or disbursing proceeds through intermediaries). Fifth, attack the probative weight of the mortgage and jewelry transactions as possibly contemporaneous or reactive attempts to avoid criminal exposure rather than true evidence of a lack of criminal intent. Appellate counsel could argue that, viewed in context and accorded the deference due the trial court’s determination of credibility, the trial court’s verdict should stand because it found the necessary fraudulent intent based on the totality of evidence. The strategy on appeal would be to argue that the Supreme Court improperly reweighed credibility and substituted its own view for that of the trial court.

## Conversely, if you were defense counsel, what lines of argument would you emphasize to secure an acquittal, based solely on the record?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
As defense counsel, the record offers several persuasive lines of argument to secure acquittal. First and foremost, emphasize the bank’s own admission of practice through Manager Garcia’s testimony that BPI honored checks drawn against uncollected deposits for long‑standing depositors with good credit standing. This demonstrates that the bank knowingly extended accommodation and that appellant’s actions fit within this established arrangement. Second, present the detailed bank statements and Ignacio’s testimony explaining "JE" entries, OD subtotals, and clearing periods to show that the postings and honors reflected routine accounting and clearing practices rather than surreptitious deception. Third, highlight the absence of charges against the branch manager who directly handled these transactional honors (Garcia) and stress that his non-prosecution makes it unlikely that appellant acted in a covert scheme of deception without his cooperation. Fourth, point to the fact that one of the deposited RCBC checks actually cleared, and the appellant issued checks to third parties rather than withdrawing cash or transferring proceeds directly to herself, which is inconsistent with an intent to steal. Fifth, stress the appellant’s subsequent steps — the mortgage, promissory note, and transfer of jewelry — as clear evidence of an intent to make restitution and not to permanently deprive the bank of funds. By combining these factual points and underscoring reasonable alternative explanations for the bank’s losses, defense counsel can credibly argue that the prosecution failed to prove criminal intent beyond reasonable doubt.

## How did the appellate Court treat the trial court's factual findings and credibility determinations in arriving at its conclusion?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Supreme Court took a holistic view of the evidence rather than mechanically deferring to the trial court’s factual findings. Although the trial court had convicted the accused, the appellate Court re-examined the record — including witness testimony, documentary exhibits, the appellant’s admissions, and the surrounding circumstances — and concluded that the evidence did not exclude reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s criminal intent. In doing so, the Court effectively disagreed with the trial court’s assessment of whether the totality of evidence established the essential mens rea beyond reasonable doubt. While appellate courts commonly show deference to trial courts on credibility, the Supreme Court retains the authority to reappraise the evidentiary record in criminal cases where it concludes that the prosecution’s proof is insufficient. In this case, the Supreme Court applied that authority and reached a contrary conclusion, acquitting the appellant on the basis that the cumulative defense evidence — especially the bank managers’ testimony and the documentary bank statements — created reasonable doubt that the trial court had not overcome.

## What procedural or factual observations did the Court make about the manager’s retirement and how did that influence credibility?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The Court observed that Branch Manager Manuel L. Garcia, who had been the manager at the time of the transactions and who testified regarding the bank’s practice of honoring checks for depositors of good standing, was not prosecuted as a co-principal and had been allowed to retire. The Court treated this as a relevant factual observation: if there had been convincing evidence that the manager had knowingly cooperated in a fraudulent scheme with the appellant, one would expect the prosecution to have pursued charges against him as well. The manager’s retirement and the absence of any charge suggested to the majority that there was no persuasive evidence of his active criminal collaboration. Consequently, the manager’s non-prosecution and retirement touched on the issue of credibility and plausibility of the prosecution’s theory: it made the existence of an isolated, purely depositor‑driven fraud less credible and lent support to the defense account that the honors were an extension of standard banking accommodations.

## What final instruction or takeaway did the majority give regarding the sufficiency of evidence for conviction?

<details>
<summary><em>Show Answer</em></summary>
<p>
The majority’s final takeaway was that the guilt of the appellant had not been demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt. The Court emphasized that the prosecution failed to exclude reasonable alternative explanations created by the evidence — notably, bank practices of honoring checks against uncollected deposits for trusted depositors, corroborating testimony from bank officers, and the appellant’s subsequent efforts to reduce the bank’s loss. Given that criminal culpability requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of such credible alternative explanations compelled the Court to set aside the conviction and enter an acquittal. The instruction implicit in the decision is that, in criminal prosecutions involving banking transactions, courts must carefully distinguish between ordinary banking accommodations and deliberate fraudulent misrepresentations, and that the presence of plausible innocent explanations must be given weight against a charge of estafa unless the prosecution proves intent to defraud with convincing clarity.

<p>
In People v. Teresa Jalandoni (G.R. No. L-57555, May 30, 1983), the Supreme Court reversed a trial court conviction for estafa under Article 315(2)(a) and acquitted the accused because the prosecution failed to prove criminal intent beyond reasonable doubt; the Court relied on evidence that the accused had been granted overdraft/drawn-against-uncollected-deposit privileges, testimony from bank managers confirming the bank’s practice of honoring checks for depositors of good standing, documentary bank statements showing recurring overdrafts and journal-entry deposits, the fact that the branch manager was not prosecuted, the honoring of one deposited check, issuance of checks in favor of third parties, and the accused’s post-event efforts to reduce the bank’s loss — all of which together created reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to defraud the bank.
