## Case Title and Citation
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, plaintiff-appellant, vs. WONG CHENG (alias WONG CHUN), defendant-appellee.  
G.R. No. 18924, October 19, 1922

Ponente: *Justice Araullo*

## Facts
- The People charged Wong Cheng with illegally smoking opium aboard the merchant vessel Changsa, of English nationality, while the vessel was anchored in Manila Bay, two and a half miles from the shore of the city.  
- The Court of First Instance of Manila sustained the demurrer filed by the defendant, ruling that the court lacked jurisdiction, and dismissed the case.  
- The Attorney-General appealed, contending that Philippine courts have jurisdiction over offenses committed on foreign vessels anchored within territorial waters.  
- The core issue is whether the courts of the Philippines have jurisdiction over a crime committed aboard a foreign merchant vessel anchored in Philippine waters.  
- The Supreme Court discussed two international-law rules: the French rule (crimes on foreign vessels are not prosecuted domestically unless they affect the territory’s peace and security) and the English rule (jurisdiction generally lies with the country whose territorial waters contain the act). The Court found the English rule prevailing in this jurisdiction due to American authority.  
- The Court referenced *The Schooner Exchange v. M’Faddon*, *United States v. Bull*, and *Look Chaw*, among others, to explain the development of territorial jurisdiction and the distinction between acts disturbing the ship’s discipline versus those disturbing public order on land.  
- It was noted that mere possession of opium aboard a foreign vessel in transit does not constitute a triable offense in the Philippines, as it does not affect the territory. However, smoking opium within territorial limits constitutes a breach of public order and falls within local jurisdiction.  
- The decision emphasized that the concept of public order in port limits justifies jurisdiction over acts occurring within territorial waters, and subversive acts occurring on land could not be left to a vessel’s consul.

## Issues
1. Did the Court of First Instance have jurisdiction over the offense of smoking opium aboard a foreign merchant vessel anchored in Manila Bay within Philippine territorial waters?  
2. Is the mere possession of opium aboard a foreign vessel in transit a crime triable by the Philippine courts, or does jurisdiction depend on the act’s occurrence within territorial limits (e.g., smoking opium in territorial waters)?

## Ruling
1. **Yes** — Philippine courts have jurisdiction over the offense of smoking opium aboard a foreign merchant vessel anchored in Manila Bay within territorial waters.  
2. **No** — The mere possession of opium aboard a foreign vessel in transit is not triable by Philippine courts; however, smoking opium within territorial limits constitutes a breach of public order and is triable locally.

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi
- The Court rejected the exclusive French-rule approach in favor of the English-rule framework, which places jurisdiction over offenses committed on foreign ships within a country’s territorial waters.  
- Authorities from United States jurisprudence (*The Schooner Exchange v. M’Faddon*; *United States v. Bull*; *Look Chaw*) support that ships in port are subject to the territorial jurisdiction, especially for acts that disturb public order within the territory.  
- The mere possession of opium aboard a vessel in transit does not create a jurisdictional basis for Philippine courts because the effects of possession are not felt within Philippine territory; the offense is not a disturbance of public order in the territorial sense.  
- Smoking opium inside Philippine territorial limits, even if on a foreign vessel, does produce pernicious effects within the territory, and thus disputes the public order protected by local law.  
- The court held that the order sustaining the demurrer was erroneous and proceeded to reverse it, remanding the case for further proceedings in accordance with law.  

---

## Doctrine / Legal Principle
- Jurisdiction over crimes committed on foreign vessels within territorial waters follows the English rule (territorial principle) as applied by Philippine jurisprudence during the period.  
- Acts disturbing public order within territorial limits are triable by the local sovereign.  
- Distinguishing between mere possession of prohibited substances aboard a foreign vessel in transit (not triable) and use (smoking) within territorial limits (triable).  
- International law principles as interpreted by U.S. jurisprudence inform Philippine practice in matters involving foreign vessels in territorial waters.  

---

## Disposition
- The order of the Court of First Instance sustaining the demurrer is revoked.  
- The case is remanded to the Court of First Instance for further proceedings in accordance with law, without special findings as to costs.

## Significance / Notes
- Establishes that Philippine courts have jurisdiction over certain narcotics offenses committed aboard foreign vessels within territorial waters when the conduct affects public order within the territory.  
- Distinguishes between mere possession aboard ship and the act of using (smoking) opium on Philippine soil or within territorial waters.  
- Reflects the influence of United States jurisprudence on Philippine law at the time and the integration of international-law doctrines into domestic criminal jurisdiction.  
- Provides a doctrinal basis for subsequent cases addressing criminal acts on foreign vessels anchored in Philippine waters.
