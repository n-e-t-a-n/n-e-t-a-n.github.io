## Facts
- February 17, 1978: President Marcos issued Proclamation No. 1716 reserving land in the Municipality of San Juan for municipal government center site purposes.  
- The land covered by Proclamation No. 1716 was occupied by squatters; the Municipality of San Juan purchased an 18-hectare lot in Taytay, Rizal as a resettlement center for these squatters, to enable development of the government center.  
- The municipality constructed the INP Building (now PNP Headquarters and Fire Station Headquarters), and housing facilities for two Municipal Trial Courts and the Office of the Municipal Prosecutors; also built the Central Post Office Building and the Municipal High School Annex Building.  
- October 6, 1987: President Aquino issued Proclamation No. 164 amending Proclamation No. 1716 by excluding from operation parcels not being utilized for government center purposes but actually occupied for residential purposes and declaring the land open to disposition under the Public Land Act, subject to future survey; the land described included Lot 1 (Port.) Psu-73270, Lot 4 (Port.) Psd-740 and Psd-810, Lot 5 (Port.) Psu-73270, among others.  
- June 1, 1988: Corazon de Jesus Homeowners Association, Inc. filed with the Regional Trial Court of Pasig a petition for prohibition with urgent prayer for a restraining order against the Municipal Mayor and Engineer of San Juan and the Curator of Pinaglabanan Shrine, to enjoin removal or demolition of houses of association members who claimed the lots had been awarded to them by Proclamation No. 164.  
- September 14, 1990: RTC dismissed the petition, ruling the disputed land was being utilized by the Municipality for government purposes, hence the condition in Proclamation No. 164 was absent.  
- Appeal to Court of Appeals was dismissed in a decision dated July 17, 1991; judgment became final and was entered on April 8, 1992.  
- Subsequently, private respondents hired surveyors to prepare consolidation-subdivision plans and submitted them to DENR in connection with their application for a grant under Proclamation No. 164.  
- To prevent DENR from issuing any grant, the Municipality filed a petition for prohibition with prayer for TRO and preliminary injunction against DENR and private respondents. The RTC sustained the petition, enjoining DENR from disposing and awarding parcels under Proclamation No. 164.  
- The Court of Appeals reversed the RTC. This prompted the current petition for review.  
- Central issue: interpretation of Proclamation No. 164 in relation to Proclamation No. 1716; whether Proclamation No. 164 is valid and enforceable; and related res judicata questions.

## Issues
1. Did Proclamation No. 164 constitute a valid exercise of legislative power by the President?
2. Is Proclamation No. 164 binding and enforceable against the Municipality and private respondents?
3. Is there res judicata applicable to the case as to the area covered by Proclamation No. 164?

---

## Ruling
1. No — Proclamation No. 164 was not a valid exercise of legislative power; it is void.  
2. No — Proclamation No. 164 is void and unenforceable; the DENR is enjoined from enforcing it.  
3. Yes — res judicata applies to the portion of land covered by Proclamation No. 164 that was the subject of the prior proceeding, though the proclamation itself is null.

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi
- Issue 1: Proclamation No. 1716 (Feb 17, 1978) validly established government center land; Proclamation No. 164 (Oct 6, 1987) attempted to amend 1716 to exclude parcels and to open land to disposition under the Public Land Act. After February 1986, the government’s legislative power was constrained; under the Freedom Constitution, the President’s legislative power persisted only until Congress was elected and convened under a new constitution. By Oct 6, 1987, legislative power resided in Congress, not the President; thus Proclamation No. 164 was an invalid exercise of legislative power and must be treated as void. The Court emphasized the principle that a statute is presumed valid only when duly enacted by the legislature; here there was a clear usurpation of legislative power by the executive branch. Citations: Salas v. Jarencio, 48 SCRA 734 (1970); Peralta v. Comelec, 82 SCRA 30 (1978); Mangoma v. Court of Appeals, 241 SCRA 21 (1995); Suarez v. Municipality of Naujan, 18 SCRA 682 (1966). The Court also invoked Article II, Section 1 of the Freedom Constitution and the transition of legislative power away from the Presidency after Congress convened.
- Issue 2: Since Proclamation No. 164 is void, it cannot bind or authorize disposition of land; DENR’s attempted grant under 164 cannot stand, and the relief against enforcement was proper. The Court rejected the notion that an invalid proclamation could operate to divest property or confer rights.
- Issue 3: Elements of res judicata require (a) final judgment, (b) lack of lack of jurisdiction, (c) on the merits, and (d) identity of parties, subject matter, and cause of action. The Court found identity of parties and cause of action largely present, and substantial identity of subject matter within the portion of land covered by Proclamation No. 164; thus res judicata applied to that area, despite the later invalidation of 164. This analysis relied on Mangoma v. Court of Appeals and Suarez v. Municipality of Naujan for the doctrine of res judicata.

## Doctrine / Legal Principle
- Separation of powers: Proclamations amending acts of the legislature must come from legitimate legislative action; unilateral executive amendments to proclamations are not valid.  
- Presumption of validity of laws: A statute is presumed valid unless it clearly contravenes the Constitution; this presumption does not apply when there is clear usurpation of legislative power by the executive.  
- Res judicata: Four essential elements—final judgment; jurisdiction; on the merits; identity of parties, subject matter, and cause of action (substantial identity is acceptable).  
- Public Land Act disposition: Land open to disposition under the Public Land Act requires proper constitutional and statutory authority.

---

## Disposition
- The decision of the Court of Appeals is SET ASIDE.  
- The Department of Environment and Natural Resources is permanently ENJOINED from enforcing Proclamation No. 164.  
- The ruling resolves the central dispute in favor of the Municipality regarding the void status of Proclamation No. 164, with specific note to the res judicata effect for the area previously covered by 164.

## Concurring / Dissenting Opinions
- The decision notes that Justices Narvasa (Chief Justice), Romero, Francisco, and Panganiban concurred with the majority; no separate concurring or dissenting opinions are stated beyond the main opinion.

---

## Significance / Notes
- This case reinforces the principle that executive actions cannot amend or repeal a legislative act, especially in the context of land disposition and government center siting.  
- It clarifies the constitutional regime governing the separation of powers during the post-1986 transition and the limits of executive power under the Freedom Constitution.  
- It underscores the application of res judicata to portions of land disputes where prior judgments address the rights to those portions, even when other parts of the related proclamations are later deemed invalid.
