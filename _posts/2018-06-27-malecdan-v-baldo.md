- On August 14, 2014, Atty. Baldo appeared as counsel for the spouses Baldo during the hearing before the Punong Barangay.
- On August 18, 2014, Malecdan filed a Complaint-Affidavit with the IBP Baguio-Benguet Chapter seeking sanctions against Baldo for alleged violation of PD 1508.
- On August 20, 2014, the IBP Committee on Ethics furnished Baldo with a copy of the complaint and set a conciliation conference for September 12, 2014.
- On September 15, 2014, the Complaint was endorsed to the CBD-IBP after the parties failed to settle.
- The CBD-IBP issued an order on September 17, 2014, requiring Baldo to submit a verified answer within 15 days.

- On February 23, 2015, the mandatory conference was rescheduled to March 24, 2015 after Baldo failed to attend.
- In Baldo’s Answer dated February 23, 2015, Baldo admitted being present at the barangay proceedings and claimed he was permitted to participate in dialogue with the complainant and his companion to amicably settle the matter.

## Issues
1. Did Atty. Baldo’s appearance before the Lupon in the Katarungang Pambarangay proceedings violate Section 9 of Presidential Decree 1508 (PD 1508)?
2. Is reprimand with a stem warning the appropriate sanction for such violation?

---

## Ruling
1. Yes — Baldo’s appearance before the Lupon violated Section 9 of PD 1508 (Katarungang Pambarangay), which requires personal confrontation between the parties without counsel, and the exceptions are exclusive to minors and incompetents.
2. Yes — The appropriate sanction is reprimand with a stem warning; the act warranted a more severe sanction if repeated.

---

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi
- Section 9 of PD 1508 mandates personal confrontation of the parties without the intervention of counsel or representative, establishing a mandatory requirement for barangay conciliation proceedings.
- Ledesma v. Court of Appeals (286 Phil. 917, 1992) supports that the personal confrontation is essential to the effectiveness of barangay conciliation and that the language is mandatory; the “expressio unius est exclusio alterius” principle reinforces that only the stated exceptions (minors and incompetents) are allowed.
- The barangay proceedings in question occurred with Baldo acting as counsel for the spouses Baldo, which contravened the PD 1508 mandate.
- Baldo admitted to participating in the proceedings and did not establish any permissible exception under PD 1508; his actions breached Canon 1 and Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR), which require lawyers to obey laws and legal processes.
- The IBP Board of Governors’ reprimand was upheld as the appropriate sanction, given the circumstances and the absence of a clear prohibition against appearances in this context, but the act warranted a warning to deter repetition.

---

## Doctrine / Legal Principle
- Katarungang Pambarangay PD 1508 Section 9 imposes mandatory personal confrontation in barangay conciliation proceedings; appearances by counsel are generally prohibited.
- Expressio unius est exclusio alterius: exceptions in PD 1508 (minors and incompetents) are exclusive and not to be extended.
- Canon 1 and Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility require lawyers to obey laws and legal processes and to refrain from unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct.
- Ledesma v. Court of Appeals supports the policy rationale behind mandatory personal confrontation to facilitate amicable settlement at the barangay level.

---

## Disposition
- The Respondent, Atty. Simpson T. Baldo, is liable for violation of Canon 1 and Rule 1.01 of the CPR in connection with PD 1508 Section 9.
- He is reprimanded with a stem warning; a repetition of the same or similar act would be dealt with more severely.
- The administrative complaint is sustained; the sanction is a reprimand with stem warning.

## Concurring / Dissenting Opinions
- None indicated; the decision record shows concurrence by Justices Carpio (Chair), Peralta, Perlas-Bernabe, and Reyes, Jr.

---

## Significance / Notes
- Reasserts the mandatory nature of PD 1508’s personal appearance requirement in Katarungang Pambarangay proceedings and clarifies that counsel’s participation is generally impermissible.
- Establishes that violations by practicing attorneys may be met with reprimand and stem warnings, contributing to discipline standards for lawyers handling barangay-level disputes.
- reinforces the duty of lawyers to comply with both procedural laws and ethical standards, upholding the integrity of the barangay dispute resolution process.
