## Facts

- President Benigno S. Aquino III campaigned on an anti-corruption platform ("kung walang corrupt, walang mahirap") and was elected in May 2010.  
- On July 30, 2010, the President issued Executive Order No. 1 creating the Philippine Truth Commission of 2010 (PTC). The EO stated the PTC would "primarily seek and find the truth" and investigate "reported cases of graft and corruption ... during the previous administration" and thereafter recommend appropriate action. The Commission would be composed of a Chairman and four members acting as an "independent collegial body."
- Relevant provisions of E.O. No. 1 (summarized):
  - Section 1: Creation and primary mandate to investigate reports of large-scale graft and corruption involving third-level public officers and higher during the previous administration and recommend actions.
  - Section 2: Grants PTC "all the powers of an investigative body" under Section 37, Chapter 9, Book I of the Administrative Code, including requiring documents from Executive agencies, obtaining information from Congress and courts, issuing subpoenas, administering oaths, receiving and evaluating evidence, recommending persons as state witnesses, turning over evidence and recommendations to prosecutorial authorities, calling on investigative agencies for assistance, engaging experts, and promulgating its rules and procedure.
  - Section 11: Budget to be provided by the Office of the President.
  - Section 14: Commission to accomplish its mission on or before December 31, 2012.
  - Section 15: Publication of interim and final reports (final report published upon directive of the President).
  - Section 17: The President may expand the mandate to include prior administrations by supplemental executive order.
- Nature of the PTC as stated in E.O. No. 1 and by respondents:
  - The PTC is a fact‑finding/ad hoc investigative body within the Office of the President (ad hoc public office).
  - It is not vested with adjudicatory or quasi‑judicial power; it cannot impose penalties, hold in contempt, or prosecute on its own.
  - Its function is to collect, review and evaluate evidence and to recommend prosecution to the DOJ and the Ombudsman.
- Petitioners� main arguments (consolidated):
  - E.O. No. 1 violates separation of powers by arrogating to the Executive the legislative power to create public offices and to appropriate funds.
  - Section 31 of the Administrative Code does not authorize creation of a new public office such as the Truth Commission.
  - E.O. No. 1 duplicates or supplants powers of the Ombudsman and the DOJ.
  - E.O. No. 1 violates the equal protection clause because it targets the "previous administration" only.
  - The Truth Commission is an exercise in partisan hostility and may lead to conviction by publicity.
- Respondents (OSG) defended E.O. No. 1 on these grounds:
  - The President may create ad hoc investigative bodies and exercise investigatory powers necessary to ensure laws are faithfully executed (Section 17, Article VII, Constitution).
  - The President has continuing authority to reorganize units of the Office of the President (Section 31, Administrative Code) and past practice supports creation of investigatory bodies.
  - Funding for the PTC is an allocation of funds already appropriated to the Office of the President, not a new appropriation by Congress.
  - The PTC is a fact‑finding body that will complement, not supplant, the Ombudsman or the DOJ; its findings are recommendatory.

## Issues

1. Do petitioners have the legal standing to file their respective petitions and question Executive Order No. 1? (Yes/No)  
2. Does Executive Order No. 1 violate the principle of separation of powers by usurping the powers of Congress to create public offices and to appropriate funds? (Yes/No)  
3. Does Executive Order No. 1 supplant the investigatory or prosecutorial powers of the Ombudsman and the Department of Justice? (Yes/No)  
4. Does Executive Order No. 1 violate the equal protection clause by singling out the "previous administration" for investigation? (Yes/No)  
5. Are petitioners entitled to injunctive relief? (Yes/No)

## Ruling

1. Yes - Petitioners have standing; the legislators may defend congressional prerogatives and Biraogo is permitted to sue given the transcendental public importance of the issues.  
2. No - The President may create ad hoc investigative bodies in the exercise of his constitutional duty to ensure faithful execution of the laws; funding for the PTC is an allocation from funds appropriated to the Office of the President, not a new congressional appropriation.  
3. No - The Truth Commission is a fact-finding/recommendatory body and does not exercise quasi-judicial powers; the Ombudsman and the DOJ retain primary authority to determine probable cause and prosecute.  
4. Yes - Executive Order No. 1 violates the equal protection clause insofar as it limits the PTC�s mandate to investigations of the previous administration only; the singling out of one past administration for investigation is an arbitrary classification not justified as a reasonable means to the stated end.  
5. Yes - The Court granted the petitions and enjoined respondents from carrying out the provisions of Executive Order No. 1.

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi

1. Legal standing (Issue 1)  
   - The Court applied established standing doctrines: legislators have standing to challenge executive acts that impair the institutional powers of Congress (citing Philippine Constitution Association v. Enriquez); ordinary citizens/taxpayers can be afforded standing in matters of "transcendental importance." The Court found petitioners-legislators had a derivative institutional injury and Biraogo's petition involved issues of paramount public interest justifying relaxation of strict locus standi requirements. (Citations: Philippine Constitution Association v. Enriquez; David v. Arroyo.)  

2. President's power to create the Truth Commission (Issue 2, part)  
   - The President is vested with executive power (Article VII, Section 1) and the duty to "ensure that the laws be faithfully executed" (Article VII, Section 17). The power to investigate to obtain facts for faithful execution of the law is inherent in the presidency. The President may create ad hoc investigatory bodies to assist in performance of his duties; precedents such as Department of Health v. Camposano upheld creation of ad hoc investigating committees. The Court rejected reliance on P.D. No. 1416 as a sole basis because that decree was tied to an earlier constitutional era and is inapposite post-1987, but held the President�s inherent and statutory reorganization powers (Administrative Code) and his faithful-execution duty suffice to permit creation of ad hoc investigatory bodies. (Citations: Marcos v. Manglapus; Department of Health v. Camposano; Administrative Code Sec. 31.)  

3. Appropriation of funds (Issue 2, part)  
   - The Court found no unlawful usurpation of Congress�s appropriation power: funds for the PTC were to be provided by the Office of the President from amounts already appropriated to it. The Court distinguished appropriation from allotment/allocation of appropriated funds and noted existing budgetary and audit controls.  

4. Whether the Truth Commission supplants the Ombudsman/DOJ (Issue 3)  
   - The Commission was held to be a fact-finding/recommendatory body and not a quasi‑judicial or prosecutorial body. Quasi‑judicial power involves adjudicatory authority to apply law to facts and issue binding determinations; the PTC lacks those powers (no contempt, no power to cite or to try and convict). The PTC may have subpoena and document‑gathering powers but it cannot determine probable cause for filing information in court; that remains with the Ombudsman and the DOJ. The PTC's role was characterized as complementary; the Ombudsman/DOJ retain primary jurisdiction over Sandiganbayan cases. (Citations: Cariño v. Commission on Human Rights; Ombudsman v. Galicia; R.A. No. 6770.)  

5. Equal protection (Issue 4) — why the Court struck E.O. No. 1  
   - The Court applied the established four-prong reasonableness test for classification under equal protection: (1) rests on substantial distinctions; (2) germane to the purpose of the law; (3) not limited to existing conditions only; and (4) applies equally to members of the same class. The Court found E.O. No. 1 expressly limited the Commission to investigating "reported cases of graft and corruption ... during the previous administration" and thus created an underinclusive classification that arbitrarily singled out the previous administration. The Court concluded that the distinctions offered by respondents (e.g., immediacy, availability of evidence, practical limitations of resources) were not substantial enough to justify excluding earlier administrations which had also been allegedly blemished with comparable reports of large-scale corruption. The Court rejected the Solicitor General�s argument that Section 17 of E.O. No. 1 (permitting expansion by subsequent executive order) cured the underinclusion, holding that such future expansion dependent solely on the President's discretion does not guarantee equal treatment and left the classification subject to "whim and caprice." Accordingly, the Court struck down E.O. No. 1 insofar as it violated the equal protection clause. (Citations: Victoriano v. Elizalde Rope Workers� Union; US v. Cyprian; relevant Equal Protection jurisprudence cited in the opinion.)  

6. Injunctive relief (Issue 5)  
   - Because the Court found a constitutional violation (equal protection) in the scope of E.O. No. 1, it granted the petitions and issued injunctive relief, ordering respondents to cease and desist from carrying out the provisions of Executive Order No. 1.

## Doctrine / Legal Principle

- The President has inherent authority to form ad hoc investigative bodies to aid in ensuring the faithful execution of laws (Article VII, Section 17).  
- Section 31, Administrative Code grants the President continuing authority to reorganize the Office of the President, but it does not alone validate creation of independent public offices outside constitutional bounds.  
- Fact‑finding (investigatory) bodies are not quasi‑judicial: receiving evidence and recommending prosecution is distinct from making binding adjudications or determining probable cause.  
- The equal protection clause permits reasonable classifications but forbids arbitrary singling out; classifications must rest on substantial distinctions, be germane to the purpose, not be limited to existing conditions only, and apply equally to members of the same class.

---

## Disposition

- The consolidated petitions are GRANTED.  
- Executive Order No. 1 is declared UNCONSTITUTIONAL insofar as it violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.  
- Respondents are ordered to cease and desist from carrying out the provisions of Executive Order No. 1.  
- Other portions of E.O. No. 1 not invalidated by the equal protection holding remain subject to existing law and are unaffected by this ruling.

## Concurring / Dissenting Opinions

- Separate opinions filed: Chief Justice Renato C. Corona (separate opinion), Justice Arturo D. Brion (separate concurring opinion), Justice Lucas P. Bersamin (separate opinion), Justice Jose Portugal Perez (separate opinion).  
- Dissenting and other separate opinions: Justice Antonio T. Carpio (dissent), Justice Teresita J. Leonardo‑De Castro (separate), Justice Roberto A. Abad (separate dissent), Justice Antonio Eduardo B. Nachura (concurrence), Justice Diosdado M. Peralta (separate concurrence), Justice Maria Lourdes P.A. Sereno (dissent).  
- Several Justices filed extended separate opinions addressing: the nature and limits of presidential investigatory power; concerns on due process, truth‑telling and public priming; the doctrine of separation of powers; and equal protection arguments.

---

## Significance / Notes

- Practical effect: The Truth Commission created under Executive Order No. 1 is enjoined from acting; the President may still create fact‑finding ad hoc bodies, but must ensure their mandates and scope do not single out classes in a way that violates equal protection.  
- Presidential authority: The decision recognizes a constitutional basis for the President to create ad hoc investigative bodies to assist in faithfully executing the laws, but draws a constitutional boundary where the Executive may not impose a discriminatory scope that targets a single past administration to the exclusion of similarly situated periods.  
- Ombudsman/DOJ relationship: The ruling reiterates that fact‑finding commissions may gather and recommend, but the constitutional and statutory roles of the Ombudsman and the DOJ in determining probable cause and prosecuting alleged corruption remain intact.  
- Drafting guidance: Executive instruments creating investigatory bodies should (1) define the scope without arbitrary temporal singling‑out, (2) provide for objective selection criteria, (3) avoid vesting quasi‑judicial powers in purely fact‑finding bodies, and (4) ensure accountability and auditing for use of funds.  
- Political and constitutional balance: The decision underscores the Court�s role to maintain the constitutional balance between enabling the executive to investigate and preventing executive action from creating a vehicle of selective enforcement that would undermine the equal protection guarantee.
