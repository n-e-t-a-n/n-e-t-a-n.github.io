## Issues
1. Does the Supreme Court have jurisdiction over the Electoral Commission and the subject matter of the controversy as presented?
2. Did the Electoral Commission act without or in excess of its jurisdiction in taking cognizance of the protest filed by Pedro Ynsua after the National Assembly's confirmation resolution of December 3, 1935?

---

## Ruling
1. Yes - The Supreme Court has jurisdiction to determine constitutional boundaries and to adjudicate conflicts between constitutional organs, including controversies involving the Electoral Commission.
2. No - The Electoral Commission did not act without or in excess of its jurisdiction; it legitimately exercised an implied power to promulgate procedural rules (including filing periods) as incident to its constitutional authority, and the National Assembly's confirmation did not bar protests filed within the Commission's prescribed time.

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi
- Jurisdiction:
  - The Court emphasized the separation of powers and the system of checks and balances; where conflicts arise between constitutional departments or agencies, the judiciary (with the Supreme Court as final arbiter) has the duty to interpret the Constitution and settle boundaries.
  - Section 2 of Article VIII (judicial power) and the role of the judiciary as interpreter of the Constitution were invoked to support judicial review of inter-departmental conflicts.
  - The controversy presented an actual constitutional conflict between the National Assembly and the Electoral Commission; therefore the Supreme Court could and should determine the limits of the Electoral Commission's constitutional grant.

- Scope of Electoral Commission's Authority:
  - Section 4, Article VI of the Constitution was central: the Electoral Commission is "the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns and qualifications of the members of the National Assembly."
  - Historical and drafting context from the Constitutional Convention showed the framers intended to transfer to the Electoral Commission the powers formerly exercised by the legislature to decide election contests; this transfer was intended to create an independent, nonpartisan tribunal.
  - Where a general power is conferred, every particular power necessary for its exercise is implied (coextensive incidental powers doctrine). Thus the Commission's exclusive authority to judge contests carries with it the incidental power to adopt rules and prescribe the time and manner for filing protests.
  - Prior statutory and constitutional arrangements (Jones Law sec. 18; Act No. 3387, sec. 478) that had permitted each house to set procedural rules were effectively superseded by the Constitution's grant to the Electoral Commission; confirmation practices under the prior regime do not override the new constitutional scheme.
  - The National Assembly's Resolution No. 8 of December 3, 1935, confirming unprotested returns, was not a constitutional mechanism to bar later-filed protests and could not preclude the Commission from setting its own filing period, especially when the Commission had not yet organized at the time of the Assembly's confirmation.
  - Accordingly, the Electoral Commission lawfully adopted December 9, 1935 as the last day to file protests and had jurisdiction to hear Ynsua's protest filed within that period.
- The Court declined to decide whether the Electoral Commission is an "inferior tribunal, corporation, board or person" under sections 226 and 516 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as that question was unnecessary to disposition.

- Authorities and materials relied upon in reasoning included:
  - Section 4, Article VI of the Constitution (Electoral Commission clause).
  - Constitutional Convention debates and the history of the provision's drafting.
  - Prior statutes and practice (e.g., Jones Law provisions and Act No. 3387, sec. 478) as context for the change effected by the Constitution.
  - Veloso v. Boards of Canvassers of Leyte and Samar (1919) cited for prior characterization of legislative power over elections.
  - General doctrines on implied/incidental powers and separation of powers.

## Doctrine / Legal Principle
- The judiciary has authority to resolve constitutional conflicts between departments and agencies; judicial review applies to inter-departmental disputes in actual controversies.
- A constitutional grant of exclusive adjudicatory power ("sole judge") to a tribunal implies authority to adopt necessary procedural rules to effectuate that power.
- Transfer of the power to decide election contests from the legislature to a constitutionally created independent tribunal carries with it the incidental power to regulate procedure, including time limits for filing protests.
- Legislative confirmation of election returns does not, by itself, bar a constitutionally authorized tribunal from entertaining timely protests filed under rules the tribunal promulgates.
- Remedies for alleged abuses of the tribunal's regulative power are primarily political or institutional, unless a justiciable legal question is presented for judicial determination.

---

## Disposition
- Petition for writ of prohibition denied.
- Costs awarded against the petitioner.
- Effect: The Electoral Commission was permitted to proceed with the protest filed by Pedro Ynsua; the National Assembly's December 3, 1935 confirmation did not bar the Commission's jurisdiction over protests filed within the period the Commission prescribed.

## Concurring / Dissenting Opinions
- Abad Santos, J., concurred in the result and in most views of the opinion but reserved on some conclusions. He emphasized:
  - The Commission's power to judge contests is judicial in nature, while fixing the time for notices is legislative in character.
  - Section 478 of Act No. 3387 (Election Law), as continued in force by Article XV, section 2 of the Constitution, could be construed to vest procedural rule-making authority in the body now exercising contest jurisdiction (the Electoral Commission).
  - He concluded nevertheless that the Electoral Commission was authorized to adopt the December 9, 1935 rule and had jurisdiction over Ynsua's protest.

---

## Significance / Notes
- Establishes that the Supreme Court may adjudicate constitutional disputes between the National Assembly and the Electoral Commission.
- Confirms that a constitutionally created tribunal with exclusive adjudicatory authority possesses implied procedural powers necessary to exercise that authority, including setting filing deadlines.
- Clarifies that routine legislative confirmations of returns do not automatically extinguish the right to file election protests under rules set by the constitutionally designated adjudicator.
- Repeals implicitly prior statutory arrangements that lodged procedural regulation in the legislature for contests now assigned to the Electoral Commission.
- Emphasizes political remedies and institutional checks as primary responses to potential abuses of procedural discretion by constitutional tribunals, subject to judicial review in appropriate cases.
