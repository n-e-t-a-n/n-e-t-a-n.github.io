## Facts
- The petitioners are a group of numerous minors, represented by their parents, joined by the Philippine Ecological Network, Inc. (PENI). The original defendant was Secretary Factoran of the DENR; his substitution by Secretary Alcala occurred later in the proceedings.
- The action began as Civil Case No. 90-77 filed as a taxpayers’ class suit before Branch 66, Makati, RTC, seeking to cancel all existing timber license agreements (TLAs) and to cease processing, granting, renewing, or approving new TLAs. The minors asserted they represent their generation and future generations.
- The complaint asserts that the Philippines’ rainforests, now severely diminished, constitute a vital national resource whose preservation is essential for a balanced and healthful ecology. It alleged that between twenty-five and thirty million hectares historically contained rainforests, with drastic reductions shown by satellite and public records: from about 16 million hectares of rainforests 25 years earlier to approximately 1.2 million hectares of old-growth rainforests by 1987, and about 850,000 hectares remaining as virgin old-growth forest; roughly 3.89 million hectares had been licensed under TLAs for logging.
- The petition framed the ecological degradation as a direct violation of the constitutional right to a balanced and healthful ecology, and linked continued deforestation to multiple environmental harms including water shortages, erosion, siltation, loss of biodiversity, and threats to indigenous communities.
- The complaint framed the government’s duty under the Philippine Environmental Policy and constitutional provisions as a trustee obligation to protect the environment for present and future generations, citing policies in E.O. No. 192 (1987), the Administrative Code (Title XIV, Book IV), P.D. No. 1151 (1977), and P.D. No. 1152 (1977).
- Procedurally, on June 22, 1990, Factoran moved to dismiss on grounds of no cause of action and a political question; opposition followed; on July 18, 1991, the trial court granted the motion to dismiss, ruling the action impermissible as impairing contracts and as a political question.
- The petitioners sought certiorari under Rule 65 to annul the dismissal, with the court eventually determining the case was a valid class action and that it stated a prima facie cause of action, while noting the need to implead TLAs’ grantees to cancel licenses.
- The Court ultimately held that the petitioners’ complaint adequately alleged a violation of the right to a balanced and healthful ecology and that the action was justiciable, overturning the trial court’s dismissal and allowing the petition to proceed, including the potential impleading of grantees.

## Issues
1. Does the petitioners’ complaint state a cause of action to enforce the right to a balanced and healthful ecology?  
2. Is the action a political question that should be dismissed for lacking justiciability?  
3. If TLAs are considered contracts, does the non-impairment of contracts clause bar cancellation or modification in the public interest?

---

## Ruling
1. Yes — The petition states a cause of action asserting a constitutional and statutory right to a balanced and healthful ecology, with the state under a correlative duty to protect that right.
2. No — While the case involves public policy considerations, it is justiciable; the Court may adjudicate the enforcement of environmental rights against executive action where grave abuse of discretion is alleged.
3. No — TLAs are not protected from cancellation or modification in the public interest; even if treated as contracts, the state may revoke or alter them under police power to preserve public welfare, and the non-impairment clause does not bar such action when public interest requires.

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi
- The 1987 Constitution recognizes the right to a balanced and healthful ecology in Article II, Section 16, and the right to health in Section 15; this right entails correlative duties to refrain from impairing the environment.
- The Court affirmed that Nature, as a collective resource, creates duties of stewardship across generations; the minors’ representation, including their future generations, is permissible under the concept of intergenerational responsibility, constituting locus standi for a class action seeking environmental protection.
- E.O. No. 192 (1987) and the Administrative Code (Title XIV, Book IV) establish the DENR as the primary agency to conserve, manage, and regulate the country’s natural resources for present and future generations, reinforcing the petitioners’ asserted rights.
- Prior environmental statutes (P.D. Nos 1151 and 1152) reflect the policy of sustaining a balance between human activity and ecological health, including the idea that generations are trustees of the environment for successors.
- The Court emphasized that a cause of action exists where a government actor’s conduct (here, the grant/renewal of TLAs) contravenes constitutional protections or statutory policy; the complaint’s factual allegations, though broad, established prima facie rights and the corresponding obligations of the defendant.
- The non-impairment of contracts clause does not categorically foreclose the State’s power to revoke or modify licenses when national interest requires, especially where timber licenses are licenses or privileges rather than vested property rights; Tan v. Director of Forestry and other precedents acknowledge that licenses may be amended or rescinded to promote public welfare.
- The Court noted the need to implead the grantees (TLAs) to determine liability and effect on contracts, if any, before final relief could be granted; the matter thus remains subject to due process and consideration of specific contractual terms.

## Doctrine / Legal Principle
- Locus standi for intergenerational environmental rights: beneficiaries can sue to protect a balanced and healthful ecology for present and future generations.
- Constitutional environmental rights and correlative duties: the right to a balanced and healthful ecology is a state policy with enforceable implications.
- Judicial review of grave abuse of discretion: courts may entertain actions challenging executive decisions affecting environmental rights.
- Nature of timber licenses: licenses to utilize forest resources are state-regulated privileges, not irrevocable contracts; public welfare can justify modification or cancellation.
- Due process in environmental remedy: implementability requires naming indispensable parties (grantees) to determine rights and remedies effectively.
- Police power vs. non-impairment: public welfare may supersede contract protections where necessary to protect environmental health.

---

## Disposition
- The petition is GRANTED; the challenged 18 July 1991 dismissal order is set aside.
- Petitioners may amend the complaint to implead the holders/grantees of the questioned TLAs.
- No pronouncement as to costs.

## Concurring / Dissenting Opinions
- FELICIANO, J., concurring: joined the result and offered extensive rationale clarifying locus standi and the breadth of environmental rights, while suggesting the need for specificity in pleading a concrete legal right; he emphasized the potential implications for beneficiaries’ rights in environmental protection.
- Justices Narvasa, Puno, and Vitug took no part in the decision.

## Significance / Notes
- Establishes environmental rights as legally enforceable in the Philippines, including the intergenerational dimension.
- Recognizes locus standi for a broad class of plaintiffs representing present and future generations in environmental protection.
- Endorses judicial scrutiny of executive actions impacting the environment and rejects blanket non-justiciability on environmental policy questions.
- Sets procedural groundwork for requiring impleading of private grantees in environmental cases to determine contractual implications and remedies.
- Influences subsequent environmental jurisprudence by affirming constitutionalized environmental rights, the role of the DENR, and the limits of non-impairment in the face of public interest.
