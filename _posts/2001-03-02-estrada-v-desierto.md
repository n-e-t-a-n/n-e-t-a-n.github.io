## Facts
- In the May 11, 1998 elections, Joseph Ejercito Estrada was elected President and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo was elected Vice-President, both serving a six-year term starting June 30, 1998.
- Beginning in 2000, allegations of graft, jueteng, and related misconduct against Estrada triggered political turmoil and impeachment proceedings.
- A series of resignations and defections followed, culminating in intense public demonstrations beginning January 16–20, 2001 (EDSA II).
- On January 20, 2001, Arroyo took oaths as President before the Chief Justice; Estrada left Malacañang Palace that afternoon.
- Several criminal complaints were filed with the Ombudsman against Estrada (OMB Case Nos. 0-00-1629, 0-00-1754 to 0-00-1758), and a special panel was appointed to investigate.
- On February 5–6, 2001, Estrada and other parties filed GR Nos. 146710-15 (prohibition) and 146738 (quo warranto) seeking halt of Ombudsman proceedings or declaration of Arroyo as acting president, respectively.
- The Court consolidated the two cases and held urgent oral arguments in February 2001. A status-quo order temporarily enjoined the Ombudsman from resolving the cited cases pending decision.
- The core issues: whether the petitions present a justiciable controversy; whether Estrada remained President on leave; whether impeachment conviction is a prerequisite to criminal prosecution; and whether prosecutions should be enjoined for prejudicial publicity.
- The Court ultimately held that Estrada resigned, Arroyo is the de jure President, and dismissed the petitions.

## Issues
1. Are the petitions justiciable controversies?
2. If justiciable, is Estrada a President on leave while Arroyo is the Acting President?
3. Is conviction in the impeachment proceedings a condition precedent for the criminal prosecution of Estrada, and, if Estrada is still President, is he immune from criminal prosecution?
4. Should the prosecution of Estrada be enjoined due to prejudicial publicity?

---

## Ruling
1. Yes — The petitions present justiciable questions within the Court’s jurisdiction to review legal issues arising from constitutional interpretation and the separation of powers.
2. No — Estrada had resigned as President; Arroyo is the de jure President, not merely an Acting President.
3. No — Impeachment conviction is not a prerequisite for criminal prosecution, and while presidential immunity exists during tenure, Estrada was no longer President; the law does not shield ongoing criminal investigations for acts committed while in office.
4. No — There is insufficient evidence of actual prejudice to warrant enjoining the Ombudsman’s preliminary investigations.

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi
- Political Question doctrine: The Court rejected the notion that the dispute is non-justiciable political questions. It distinguished EDSA II from EDSA I, noting that EDSA II did not create a revolutionary government but involved intra-constitutional political transitions subject to judicial review. See Tanada v. Cuenco and later constitutional jurisprudence; the 1987 Constitution expands judicial review to grave abuse of discretion and to prevent constitutional mechanisms from being undermined.
- Nature of Estrada’s status: The Court examined whether Estrada resigned or was temporarily unable to govern. It considered the totality of events, including the Angara diaries and contemporaneous statements, and found that Estrada’s acts—leaving Malacañang and signaling a peaceful transition—constituted a resignation. The letter declaring inability to discharge the powers and duties did not negate the surrounding conduct indicating resignation.
- Immunity and criminal liability: The Court traced the evolution of executive immunity, citing Forbes v. Chouco Tiaco (siqu) and later constitutional history. It held that the 1987 Constitution asserts that the President is immune from suit during tenure; however, this immunity does not extend to acts committed after resignation or to shield criminal acts, particularly plunder and graft, committed during incumbency.
- Impeachment vs. criminal prosecution: The judiciary rejected the argument that criminal prosecutions must await conviction in impeachment proceedings. The impeachment process was effectively moot after Estrada’s resignation and the impeachment court’s function was terminated; criminal and civil actions may proceed in ordinary courts.
- Prejudicial publicity: The Court adopted the standard from Martelino v. Alejandro and related cases requiring showing of actual prejudice to due process, not merely sensational publicity. It found no demonstrated actual bias in the DOJ Panel or in the Ombudsman’s investigation to warrant enjoining the proceedings.

Cited authorities and precedents referenced include: Tanada v. Cuenco; Marbury v. Madison; US Supreme Court cases on presidential immunity (Nixon v. Fitzgerald; Clinton v. Jones); Forbes v. Chuoco Tiaco; Re: Saturnino Bermudez; Martelino v. Alejandro; Lawyers League for a Better Philippines v. Aquino; and Taada v. Cuenco for the political question doctrine, among others. The decision also relies on the 1987 Constitution’s Article VII, Sections 8 and 11, and related provisions, and discusses RA 3019 Section 12 in context of progressive immunity and pending investigations.

## Doctrine / Legal Principle
- Political Question doctrine limits: Some political questions may be judicially reviewable, especially where the Constitution grants the judiciary authority to review grave abuses of discretion.
- Intra-constitutional succession: A transition of power within the constitutional framework can be subject to judicial review; a revolution-like substitution (EDSA I) is not required for court intervention.
- Presidential immunity: The President is immune from suit during tenure; non-sitting presidents may be subject to criminal prosecution for acts committed during or after tenure; immunity does not shield criminal acts from investigation or prosecution after leaving office.
- Impeachment vs. criminal prosecution: Impeachment is not a prerequisite to criminal prosecution; a moot impeachment process does not bar subsequent criminal actions.
- Prejudicial publicity standard: A court should require actual prejudice or bias, not mere public notoriety, to enjoin investigations or trials.

---

## Disposition
- The petitions challenging the legitimacy of Arroyo’s presidency and requesting prohibitions against Ombudsman proceedings were DISMISSED.
- Estrada’s claims that he remained President or that Arroyo acted only in an acting capacity were rejected; Arroyo was recognized as the de jure President.
- The Ombudsman investigations against Estrada were allowed to proceed, and no injunction was granted based on prejudicial publicity.

---

## Concurring / Dissenting Opinions
- Concurrences: Justice Vitug authored a concurring opinion agreeing with the result and emphasizing prudence in evaluating the transition’s legality and the need to preserve democratic processes.
- Concurrences: Justice Mendoza authored a concurring opinion, also supporting dismissal while elaborating on the constitutional framework and the executive branch’s responsibilities during the EDSA II transition.
(Note: The decision includes separate concurrences that affirm the majority’s outcome, each providing additional reasoning.)

## Significance / Notes
- Clarifies that EDSA II was not a revolution but a constitutional transition, allowing judicial review of the resulting government’s legality.
- Establishes that impeachment proceedings, when moot, do not bar criminal prosecution for offenses committed while in office.
- Reaffirms that presidential immunity applies to acts during tenure, but does not immunize post-tenure criminal liability for acts such as graft or plunder.
- Affirms the role of the judiciary in safeguarding the rule of law during national crises and in balancing the rights of the State to prosecute with individuals’ right to due process.
- Highlights the Court’s cautious stance toward excessive publicity, requiring evidence of actual prejudice before halting ongoing investigations.
