Ponente: Justice Panganiban

## Facts
- Pilar Estipular filed a Petition for Reconstitution of Certificate of Title No. 154 before the Regional Trial Court of La Union, claiming she is the surviving legal heir of the late Fermin Estipular who owned land in Barrio Liquicia, Caba, La Union (6.1253 hectares) and that the original title was destroyed or burned when the Register of Deeds office was burned during World War II.
- The petition alleged that the land had been declared for taxation and was not mortgaged; the land had been distributed among ten heirs.
- On June 15, 1994, the trial court ordered publication of the Notice of Hearing in the Official Gazette for two successive issues and posting at the main entrance of the Municipal Building of Caba, La Union at least 30 days before the hearing (initial hearing set for September 8, 1994).
- A Certificate of Posting showed posting at the Municipal Building. The National Printing Office advised rescheduling due to publication constraints.
- On August 12, 1994, the hearing was reset to December 7, 1994.
- A second Certificate of Posting was issued; Official Gazette publications occurred on October 17 and 24, 1994.
- The Office of the Solicitor General entered appearance on November 2, 1994.
- The initial hearing occurred on December 7, 1994; the petitioner and the public prosecutor appeared; there were no oppositions registered.
- At the January 24, 1995 hearing, the petitioner presented jurisdictional facts and documentary exhibits (A through I), including the petition, verification, title, survey, description, assessor’s certification, notices, publication certificate, posting certificates, and notice of appearance.
- The RTC granted the petition for reconstitution; the CA affirmed the RTC decision.
- The Republic contends that posting at the provincial building was not accomplished, depriving the trial court of jurisdiction.

## Issues
1. Did substantial compliance with the publication and posting requirements of Republic Act No. 26 confer jurisdiction on the trial court?

---

## Ruling
1. No — The mandatory posting requirement at the main entrance of the provincial building (in addition to posting at the municipal building) is jurisdictional; publication in the Official Gazette alone does not confer jurisdiction. The trial court did not acquire jurisdiction due to the failure to post at the provincial building.

---

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi
- Republic Act No. 26, Sec. 13, requires: (a) publication of the petition twice in successive issues of the Official Gazette; (b) posting at the main entrance of the provincial building and the municipal building where the land is situated; (c) mailing to interested parties; (d) proof of publication, posting, and service at the hearing.
- The requirements are mandatory and jurisdictional. Compliance is essential to vest the court with jurisdiction to hear and decide the petition for reconstitution.
- In Calalang v. Register of Deeds, the Court recognized publication as part of due process but did not address whether posting at provincial and municipal entrances is mandatory; the present case distinguishably emphasizes that posting is also mandatory.
- The purposes of the posting requirement include safeguarding against spurious or unfounded land claims and ensuring all interested parties are apprised and can intervene.
- The trial court’s omission to order posting at the provincial building cannot be cured by publication or posting at the municipal building alone; substantial compliance cannot substitute for the mandatory requirement.
- The errors originated with the trial court’s order, and the Republic was not able to cure the lack of jurisdiction through later actions.

## Doctrine / Legal Principle
- Publication and posting of the petition for reconstitution under Republic Act No. 26 are mandatory and jurisdictional.
- Substantial compliance is insufficient to confer jurisdiction where statutorily mandated steps (especially posting at the provincial building) are omitted.
- The protective aims of these procedures are to safeguard against fraudulent claims and ensure timely, adequate notice to all interested parties.

---

## Disposition
- The petition for reconstitution is GRANTED.
- The assailed Court of Appeals decision is reversed and set aside.
- No costs.
- The trial court’s lack of jurisdiction due to noncompliance cannot be cured by later steps.

---

## Concurring / Dissenting Opinions
- The decision states that Justices Melo (Chairman), Vitug, Purisima, and Gonzaga-Reyes concurred with the majority.

---

## Significance / Notes
- Establishes a strict, jurisdictional reading of the publication and posting requirements for reconstitution under RA 26.
- Clarifies that Publication in the Official Gazette alone does not suffice; posting at both the municipal and provincial entrances is essential.
- Reinforces the protective framework for land titles by ensuring comprehensive notice to all potential claimants and interested parties.
- Important for practitioners: ensure compliance with all procedural steps, especially posting at the provincial building, to vest jurisdiction in the trial court.
