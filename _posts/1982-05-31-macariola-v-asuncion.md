## Facts
- The case arose from a verified complaint dated August 6, 1968 charging respondent Judge Elias B. Asuncion (then of the Court of First Instance of Leyte; later Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals) with acts unbecoming a judge.
- The factual setting centers on Civil Case No. 3010, a complaint for partition filed by Sinforosa R. Bales, Luz R. Bakunawa, Anacorita Reyes, Ruperto Reyes, Adela Reyes, and Priscilla Reyes against Bernardita R. Macariola, involving properties left by the deceased Francisco Reyes.
- In defenses to the partition suit, Macariola raised several theories about heirs, conjugal properties, and shares, leading to a June 8, 1963 decision by Judge Asuncion.
- The dispositive portion of the 1963 decision divided properties and recognized shares among the heirs (including distinct allocations to Macariola and others) and directed a partition project for final approval (items 1–11 of the dispositive).
- A Project of Partition was submitted by the parties on October 16, 1963 and approved by Judge Asuncion on October 23, 1963, with an amended order on November 11, 1963. The project allocated Lots 1154, 2304, 4506 to Macariola and portions to others, including a division of Lot 3416 and several other Lots.
- Lot 1184 (and in particular Lot 1184-E) was central: the 1963 partition awarded half of a one-quarter of Lot 1154 to Macariola, and Lot 1184-E was later subdivided (1184-A to 1184-E). Lot 1184-E was sold on July 31, 1964 to Arcadio Galapon.
- On March 6, 1965, Galapon sold a portion of Lot 1184-E to respondent and his wife, who later conveyed their shares in Lot 1184-E to Traders Manufacturing and Fishing Industries, Inc. (TRADERS) on August 31, 1966. TRADERS’ incorporation occurred on January 9, 1967, with respondent as President and his wife as Secretary; the respondent’s stake and that of his wife were disposed of by January 31, 1967.
- On November 9 or 11, 1968, Macariola filed Civil Case No. 4234 in the CFI Leyte seeking to annul the project of partition, the two orders approving it, and related conveyances; several defendants were later dismissed as non-parties or no longer interested.
- On November 2, 1970, Judge Jose D. Nepomuceno rendered a decision (in Civil Case No. 4234) dismissing Macariola’s complaint against most defendants, with damages awarded against Macariola in certain portions and in favor of Asuncion in others. The decision was appealed to the Court of Appeals (February 22, 1971).
- The Investigating Justice (Cecilia Muñoz Palma) concluded:
  - First cause: no merit that Asuncion violated Article 1491, paragraph 5, of the Civil Code by acquiring a portion of Lot 1184-E, since the finality of the 1963 decision and related orders occurred before the March 6, 1965 purchase; the sale was through Galapon, not directly from plaintiffs; and the final partition orders had long since become final.
  - Second cause: the Code of Commerce Article 14 was abrogated after sovereignty changes, thus not applicable to Asuncion; likewise, Section 3(h) of RA 3019 could not be applied since there was no demonstrated intervention by Asuncion in Traders’ business; and he withdrew from the corporation before any court case involving TRADERS, mitigating concerns under Canon 25.
  - Third and fourth causes: no substantial proof that Asuncion coddled an impostor or engaged in conduct constituting serious ethical violations; while social familiarity existed with Dominador Arigpa Tan, there was no showing that official acts were biased in favor of Tan.
- The record shows the court and the parties had credible explanations for the transactions, including good-faith purchases and disassociation from the corporation after its incorporation.

## Issues
1. Did respondent violate Article 1491, paragraph 5, of the New Civil Code by acquiring by purchase a portion of Lot 1184-E which was the subject of Civil Case No. 3010?
2. Did respondent violate Article 14, paragraphs 1 and 5 of the Code of Commerce, Section 3, paragraph H of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), Section 12, Rule XVIII of the Civil Service Rules, and Canon 25 by associating himself with the Traders Manufacturing and Fishing Industries, Inc. as a stockholder and ranking officer while a judge?
3. Did respondent commit coddling an impostor and disregard judicial decorum by fraternizing with Dominador Arigpa Tan?
4. Was there culpable defiance of the law and utter disregard for ethics by respondent?

---

## Ruling
1. No — there was no violation of Article 1491, paragraph 5, of the New Civil Code.
2. No — Article 14 of the Code of Commerce has no legal effect here (abrogated with sovereignty changes); nor did respondent violate RA 3019, Rule XVIII, or Canon 25 in the manner alleged.    
3. No — respondent did not commit coddling or disregard for judicial decorum.
4. No — respondent did not demonstrate culpable defiance of the law.

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi
- Article 1491, paragraph 5: The prohibition covers purchases of property in litigation by judges only if the sale occurs during the pendency of the litigation. Here, the March 6, 1965 purchase occurred after the finality of the 1963 decision and after the related orders approving the partition; the sale was not during the pendency of the litigation. The purchase was from Galapon, who had acquired Lot 1184-E earlier, and the subsequent transfers occurred long after finality, including to TRADERS; thus no violation occurred in this respect. The possibility of improper motives and appearances were acknowledged, but not sufficient to establish a violation.
- Article 14, Code of Commerce: The court emphasized that Article 14 is a political law and, following changes in sovereignty, was abrogated automatically unless expressly re-enacted. Citing Roa v. Collector of Customs, People v. Perfecto, and related authorities, the court held that Article 14 cannot apply to a judge in this jurisdictional setting.
- RA 3019 (Anti-Graft) Section 3(h) and Rule XVIII (Civil Service Rules): The court found no evidence that respondent intervened in Traders’ business in his official capacity or derived any improper financial benefit from it; the corporation’s business did not relate to any case in which respondent presided. The court also noted that RA 296 (Judiciary Act) and constitutional provisions place discipline of judges under the Supreme Court, not the Civil Service Commission; hence Section 12, Rule XVIII could not be used as a basis for discipline in this case.
- Canon 25 of the Canons of Judicial Ethics: Although the acquisition and association with a private corporation during incumbency was improper and raised questions of propriety, the respondent and his wife withdrew from the corporation on January 31, 1967, before any court case involving the corporation, indicating an appropriate step to avoid conflicts of interest. The court still recognized that the acts were not beyond reproach and advised greater discretion to avoid the appearance of impropriety.
- Third and fourth causes: The Investigating Justice’s findings supported exoneration; the record did not show that social relations with Tan influenced judicial acts; the court stressed the importance of avoiding relationships that might cast doubt on impartiality, but did not find actionable misconduct.

## Doctrine / Legal Principle
- Appearance of impropriety in judicial conduct should be avoided; judges must conduct private affairs so as not to cast doubt on impartiality (Canon 25).
- Prohibitions against judges engaging in commerce and direct financial interests in entities connected to litigation are not unlimited; changes in sovereignty can affect the continuing force of earlier political laws (e.g., Article 14, Code of Commerce).
- The discipline of judges lies within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, with specific grounds and procedures (e.g., serious misconduct and inefficiency) defined by law.

---

## Disposition
- The respondent, Associate Justice Elias B. Asuncion, is reminded to be more discreet in his private and business activities.
- The complaint was resolved with exoneration on the substantive charges beyond the admonition, and no formal punishment imposed beyond the admonition.
