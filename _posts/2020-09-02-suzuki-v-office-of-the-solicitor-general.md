Supreme Court - Second Division  
Ponente: Justice Inting

## Facts
- Petitioner, born April 4, 1988 in Manila, is the child of Sadao Kumai Suzuki (Japanese) and Lorlie Lopez Magno (Filipino). Petitioner's parents were married on December 29, 1987.  
- Based on Identification Certificate No. 08-19540, issued by the Bureau of Immigration on March 31, 2008, petitioner is a Filipino citizen.  
- Petitioner's parents divorced on June 12, 1997.  
- On December 6, 2002, Lorlie Magno married a Japanese national, Hikaru Hayashi, in San Juan City, Metro Manila.  
- On November 9, 2004, petitioner's adoption by Hayashi was effected under Japanese law; this was reflected in Hayashi's Koseki (Family Register). The Koseki and its English translation were authenticated at the Philippine Consulate General on May 15, 2007.  
- At age 16, petitioner sought to have the Japanese adoption decree recognized in the Philippines under Japanese law. On May 24, 2013, he filed a Petition for Judicial Recognition of Foreign Adoption Decree before the RTC of Marikina City.  
- On June 4, 2013, the RTC issued an Order requiring the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) to comment. The OSG, in its November 4, 2013 Comment/Opposition, argued that Philippine law limits adoptions to Filipino citizens and aliens under RA 8043 (Inter-Country Adoption Act of 1995) and RA 8552 (Domestic Adoption Act of 1998), and that petitioner's case is not domestically governed or inter-country adoptions under those acts; thus recognition should be denied.  
- On November 21, 2013, the RTC dismissed the petition for judicial recognition for being contrary to law and public policy. The RTC denied further proceedings and dismissed the petition.  
- Petitioner moved for reconsideration; the RTC denied on April 23, 2014. It maintained that RA 8043 and RA 8552 govern adoptions of Filipino citizens, and that Philippine courts are not automatically obligated to recognize a foreign judgment without a final Japanese tribunal judgment.  
- On August 7, 2017, the Court issued a Resolution directing memoranda. Petitioner argued: (1) NSO Memorandum Circular No. 2007-008 (civil registry of foreign judgments/orders includes adoptions); (2) OCRG Administrative Order Rule 53 (a foreign adoption decree is acceptable for registration in the Philippines); (3) OCRG Circular No. 90-228 (foreign adoption decrees may be accepted for registration); and (4) a modern trend toward encouraging adoption should sustain such recognition. The OSG argued: (1) petitioner's adoption is subject to Philippine law; (2) strong legislative intent to regulate adoption; (3) adoption valid only under RA 8043 or RA 8552; (4) petitioner's adoption did not occur under RA 8043 or RA 8552.  
- The case centers on whether a foreign judgment of adoption involving a Filipino citizen can be judicially recognized in the Philippines, and whether such recognition aligns with Philippine law and public policy.

## Issues
1. Did the RTC err in denying judicial recognition of the foreign adoption decree on the basis that recognizing such decree would be contrary to law and public policy?  
2. Do RA 8043 and RA 8552 govern adoptions of Filipino citizens and thereby preclude recognition of Hayashi’s Japanese adoption decree?  
3. May Philippine courts recognize a foreign judgment of adoption, and extend its effect to the Filipino party, under Section 48, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, provided the foreign judgment is proven?

---

## Ruling
1. Yes — The RTC erred in denying judicial recognition; the petition for recognition can be granted.  
2. No — RA 8043 and RA 8552 do not automatically preclude recognition of a foreign adoption decree; recognition may proceed where supported by law and proper proof.  
3. Yes — A foreign judgment of adoption, if proven as a fact, may be judicially recognized and given effect in the Philippines, subject to public policy and the usual extrinsic grounds to repel recognition; the case is remanded for proper proceedings to prove the foreign judgment and reflect it in the civil registry.

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi
- The Court reiterates that Philippine law binds Filipino citizens under Article 15 of the Civil Code, even when abroad, but that the foreign judgment against a Japanese adopter concerns the status of the foreign party; Philippine courts determine whether to extend the effect of a foreign adoption decree to the Filipino petitioner.  
- Adoption is a status created by juridical act; it fixes parent-child relationships and carries rights and duties; thus, it is subject to state regulation. The Family Code (EO 209) and statutes RA 8043 and RA 8552 form the framework for adoption.  
- Article 184(3)(b) of the Family Code recognizes that aliens may adopt under certain conditions, including that such adoptions pertain to the child of a Filipino spouse, but the applicability to Hayashi per Article 184(3)(b) is nuanced. However, RA 8043 governs inter-country adoptions, and RA 8552 governs domestic adoptions; the Court notes these do not categorically bar recognition of a foreign decree; recognition may be allowed under international-law principles.  
- The Court relies on Section 48, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, and the jurisprudence in Fujiki v. Marinay (to admit a foreign judgment as a fact and prove it through official records or authenticated copies) and Mijares v. Raada (on the general principles of recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments) to justify recognition when a foreign judgment is proven and does not contravene Philippine public policy.  
- The Court emphasizes that recognition is a matter of comity and practice in international law; the foreign judgment, if proven, is presumptively valid between the parties and their successors. The recognition of a foreign judgment relating to the status of adoption is not an automatic consequence but a controlled, fact-based process.

## Doctrine / Legal Principle
- Nationality Principle (Article 15, Civil Code): Laws relating to family rights bind Philippine citizens even when living abroad.  
- Judicial recognition of foreign judgments: Section 48, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court; recognition is possible when the foreign judgment is proven and does not violate public policy or extrinsic grounds to repel recognition.  
- General international-law approach: There is a widely accepted practice to recognize foreign judgments, even in the absence of a treaty, subject to jurisdiction, notice, collusion, fraud, or clear errors in law or fact.  
- Adoption as a status: Adoption creates a legitimate parental relationship; Philippine law regulates who may adopt and who may be adopted, with relevant provisions in the Family Code and RA 8043 (Inter-Country Adoption) and RA 8552 (Domestic Adoption).

---

## Disposition
- The RTC’s November 21, 2013 and April 23, 2014 orders are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.  
- The Regional Trial Court of Marikina City is ORDERED to REINSTATE the petition for further proceedings, in accordance with this Decision.  
- The recognition of the foreign judgment, if proven, shall be reflected in the Philippine civil registry.

## Concurring / Dissenting Opinions
- Concurring: Justices Perlas-Bernabe (Senior Associate Justice, Chair), Hernando, and Delos Santos concurred in the decision.  
- Baltazar-Padilla, J., on leave, concurred in the result.

## Significance / Notes
- The decision clarifies that a foreign adoption decree involving a Filipino citizen may be judicially recognized in the Philippines, rather than automatically denied.  
- It emphasizes that recognition is a matter of foreign judgment recognition under Section 48, Rule 39, and requires proof of the foreign judgment as a fact.  
- The ruling reconciles inter-country and domestic adoption regimes, noting that RA 8043 and RA 8552 do not automatically bar recognition of foreign adoptions; instead, recognition may proceed if the foreign judgment is properly proven and does not contravene Philippine public policy.  
- The decision underscores the role of international law principles (opinio juris) in Philippine practice and the need to reflect recognized foreign judgments in the civil registry when warranted.
