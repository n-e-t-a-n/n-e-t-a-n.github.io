## Facts
- In 1960 Caltex conceived a promotional scheme labeled the "Caltex Hooded Pump Contest" to increase patronage for its oil products. Participation was open to all motor vehicle owners and licensed drivers, with certain exclusions for Caltex employees, dealers, and their immediate families. No fee or purchase was required to participate.
- Entry forms were available at Caltex stations, with sealed cans for entry stubs.
- The contest envisaged a three-stage winners system:
  - Station level "Dealer Contest": the closest estimate to the actual liters dispensed by the hooded pump receives first prize; the next closest, second; the next, third. Prizes included a kerosene stove, a thermos bottle and a lantern, and a flashlight with tools.
  - Regional Contest: station-level winners advance to seven regional contests; regional winners’ stubs are drawn to determine regional first/second/third prizes.
  - National Contest: regional winners’ stubs are drawn to select national first/second/third prizes; cash prizes are awarded, plus a consolation prize for remaining participants.
- Caltex anticipated extensive use of the mails for publicity and communications and sought advance clearance under the postal provisions (Sections 1954(a), 1982, 1983 of the Revised Administrative Code). The Acting Postmaster General declined clearance, asserting the scheme fell within the anti-lottery provisions.
- Caltex submitted a reconsideration; the Postmaster General maintained that the contest involves consideration or, at least, qualifies as a prohibited "gift enterprise." Caltex filed for declaratory relief seeking a ruling that the contest did not violate the Postal Law.
- The trial court ruled in Caltex’s favor, holding that the proposed contest did not violate the Postal Law and that respondent had no right to bar dissemination of the rules by mail. The Postmaster General appealed.

## Issues
1. Did the petition state a sufficient cause of action for declaratory relief?
2. Does the Caltex Hooded Pump Contest violate the Postal Law?

---

## Ruling
1. Yes - The petition states a justiciable controversy suitable for declaratory relief; there is an actual dispute over the interpretation and application of the Postal Law, and a declaration would stabilize rights and duties.
2. No - The contest does not violate the Postal Law because it lacks the element of consideration required for a lottery; and even under a broader interpretation as a gift enterprise, it still does not meet the prohibited criteria since there is no required consideration.

---

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi
- Declaratory relief: Under the rules in effect, a party may obtain a declaration where a justiciable controversy exists, the parties have adverse interests, the petitioner has a legal interest, and the issue is ripe for determination. The dispute arose from Caltex’s request for mail clearance and the Postmaster General’s threat of a fraud order; this created a real dispute suitable for judicial resolution.
- Construction of the Postal Law: Interpreting Sections 1954(a), 1982, and 1983, the court held that the term "lottery" incorporates the elements of prize, chance, and consideration. While the contest offers prizes and involves chance, there is no consideration required to participate; no payment, no purchase, and no requisite value exchanged for entry.
- Gift enterprise analysis: The court acknowledged conflicting authorities on whether a gift enterprise (an award by chance without consideration) is prohibited. It applied noscitur a sociis and extrinsic aids to interpret the statute consistently with the nature of a lottery; where there is no consideration, the scheme does not fall within the prohibited category.
- Application to the facts: The Caltex contest invites participation without any requirement to purchase Caltex products or to pay any fee; entry forms are freely obtained, and participation is open to qualified contestants without giving anything of value. The court concluded there is no valid consideration, so the scheme is not a lottery and does not constitute a gift enterprise within the prohibition.
- Prior authorities: The court referenced Horner v. States, U.S. Supreme Court standards for lotteries, 54 C.J.S. on gift enterprises, El Debate, Inc. v. Topacio, and other authorities to frame the analysis. It emphasized that gratuitous distribution of property by lot or chance is not a lottery when no consideration is present.
- Policy and remedy: A declaratory judgment serves to settle rights and duties under the law, preventing enforced censorship or unwarranted restraint on lawful promotional activities when no violation is present.

## Doctrine / Legal Principle
- Declaratory relief is available to settle doubts about the construction or validity of a statute when there is a justiciable controversy.
- For a scheme to be condemned as a lottery under the Postal Law, it must involve consideration, prize, and chance; absence of consideration defeats the lottery characterization.
- Gift enterprises are prohibited only if they involve consideration; gratuitous distribution without consideration does not automatically constitute a lottery or a prohibited gift enterprise under the Postal Law.
- Noscitur a sociis: interpret related terms (lottery and gift enterprise) in light of the surrounding words to determine legislative intent.
- Extrinsic aids may be used in statutory construction to align with public policy aims of preventing mail-based schemes that promote gambling or deception.

---

## Disposition
- The judgment appealed from is affirmed. No costs.
- The petition for declaratory relief is sustained insofar as it held that the Caltex Hooded Pump Contest does not violate the Postal Law and that the Postmaster General’s objections were unfounded.

---

## Concurring / Dissenting Opinions
- None. All justices concur in the result.

---

## Significance / Notes
- Establishes that declaratory relief can be used to resolve questions about the validity or interpretation of the Postal Law in promotional schemes.
- Clarifies the elements required to characterize a lottery under postal restrictions, emphasizing that consideration is essential.
- Reinforces a protective approach to promotional contests: if a contest does not require consideration from participants, it may not be deemed a lottery or prohibited gift enterprise.
- Provides a jurisprudential framework for evaluating future advertising promotions under the postal regulations and for determining when mail clearance is appropriate.
