## Facts
- The defendant, Ah Chong, was employed as a cook at Officers' quarters No. 27, Fort McKinley, Rizal Province; Pascual Gualberto was employed as a house boy at the same location.
- Officers' quarters No. 27 is a detached house about 40 meters from the nearest building, occupied in August 1908 solely as an officers' mess or club; only the two servants slept there, occupying a small rear room with a door opening onto a narrow porch.
- The room had no permanent bolt or lock; occupants used a small hook on the inside and reinforced it with a chair placed against the door. The room had one small window opening onto the porch; no other openings existed.
- On the night of August 14, 1908, at about 10 o'clock, the defendant, who had taken the night shift, awoke to a forceful attempt to open the room door; he sat up, called out, and, perceiving an intrusion, warned, “If you enter the room, I will kill you.”
- Due to darkness from vines along the porch, the intruder seemed to push the door; the defendant was struck just above the knee by the edge of the chair placed against the door. Believing a burglar was assaulting him, he grabbed a kitchen knife and struck out at the intruder, who was later determined to be his roommate, Pascual.
- Pascual ran to the porch, collapsed on the steps in a severely wounded condition; the defendant followed, recognized Pascual in the moonlight, and then went to fetch bandages to treat the wounds.
- There had been several robberies in Fort McKinley prior to the incident; the defendant testified that he kept a knife under his pillow for protection.
- Pascual had left the house earlier that evening to walk with Celestino Quiambao and Mariano Ibáñez, servants at Officers' quarters No. 28. They returned around 10 o'clock; Pascual went to his room at No. 27.
- Celestino and Mariano heard Pascual cry for help and found Pascual mortally wounded on the back steps; they notified Lieutenants Jacobs and Healy, who assisted Pascual.
- The defendant admitted to stabbing his roommate but asserted it occurred during a mistaken belief that Pascual was a thief who forced open the door despite repeated warnings.
- Pascual died the following day at the military hospital.
- The defendant was charged with assassination and tried; the trial court convicted him of simple homicide with extenuating circumstances, sentencing six years and one day presidio mayor (the minimum penalty).
- The defendant admitted killing Pascual but claimed self-defense; he argued there was no real threat or necessity to use the knife.
- The court discusses that, under Article 8 of the Penal Code, exemptions include actions in defense of person or rights when illegal aggression exists, there is reasonable necessity, and there is lack of sufficient provocation; the court considers whether such a defense applies given the mistaken belief about the intruder's identity and intent.
- The majority opinion emphasizes that if the intruder had been a dangerous thief as the defendant believed, he would be exempt from criminal liability; however, the intruder was not such a threat, and the true state of facts did not show such danger, raising questions about the necessity and intent. The opinion also examines the broader principle that ignorance or mistake of fact can negate criminal intent, thereby cancelling the presumption of intent and leading to acquittal, provided the mistake was not due to negligence or bad faith.

## Issues
1. Was the defendant exempt from criminal liability for homicide under Article 8 due to self-defense based on a mistaken belief that the intruder was a thief, given that there was no real illegal aggression or necessity?
2. Is malice or criminal intent an essential element of homicide or assassination, and can a mistake of fact that negates that intent exempt the actor from liability?
3. If the defendant acted in self-defense based on his mistaken belief, should the conviction be reversed and the defendant acquitted?

---

## Ruling
1. Yes — The defendant is exempt from criminal liability if, under the circumstances and his mistaken belief, he acted in self-defense and there was no real illegal aggression or necessity; the mistake, provided it was not due to negligence or bad faith, negates the required malice.
2. Yes — Malice or criminal intent is generally essential, but a mistake of fact that negates the required intent can exempt the actor from liability, so long as the mistake was not caused by fault or negligence.
3. Yes — The conviction should be reversed and the defendant acquitted; the trial court’s judgment should be set aside and the bail bond exonerated.

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi
- The court reiterates the general principle (Article 1 of the Penal Code) that crimes are punished when there is a voluntary act accompanied by the requisite criminal intent; however, it recognizes exceptions where the act is committed under a reasonable mistaken belief that negates the necessary intent.
- It cites authority asserting that ignorance of the mental state (malice or criminal intent) can nullify criminal liability if the act is otherwise lawful, and that mistake of fact can excusably negate the intent required for certain offenses.
- The court emphasizes that self-defense is a recognized defense when there is illegal aggression, reasonable necessity to repel it, and lack of sufficient provocation; when the intruder is not actually a thief, the defendant’s fear does not justify killing unless his mistaken belief negates the intent to commit a crime.
- The decision supports the principle that a person acting in self-defense may rely on the facts as they appear to him at the time, and if he honestly believes that he is in imminent danger, he may be exempt from liability if there was no negligence or bad faith in forming that belief (citing Wharton's Criminal Law and various authorities). It also discusses the psychological and doctrinal distinctions between willful acts and negligent acts, noting that “voluntary” acts imply malice or criminal intent, but exceptions exist when the actor is misled in good faith.
- The opinion references Spanish and other jurisprudence to illustrate the long-standing treatment of self-defense and mistake of fact as valid defenses when the actor reasonably believes he is defending himself from imminent harm.

## Doctrine / Legal Principle
- Ignorance or mistake of fact can negate criminal intent, thereby cancelling the presumption of intent and potentially leading to acquittal, provided the mistake was not due to negligence or bad faith.
- Malice or criminal intent is typically essential to crimes, but the law recognizes exceptions when the defendant acts under a reasonable, honest mistake of fact that would have negated the necessary intent.
- Self-defense requires (a) illegal aggression, (b) reasonable necessity of the means employed to repel it, and (c) lack of sufficient provocation; if the attacker is not actually an aggressor as believed, the justification may fail unless the defendant’s mistaken belief itself negates the required mental element.
- The act punished by law can be excused if the circumstances as perceived by the defendant at the time justify self-defense and there was no fault in forming the belief.

---

## Disposition
- The judgment of conviction and sentence for simple homicide is reversed.
- The defendant, Ah Chong, is acquitted of the crime with which he was charged.
- The bail bond is exonerated; costs of both instances are assigned accordingly.

---

## Concurring / Dissenting Opinions
- The majority’s position is supported by Justices Johnson Moreland and Elliott, who concur.
- Dissenting opinions exist:
  - Arellano, C.J., and Mapa, J., dissented.
  - Torres, J., dissented, presenting a contrary view that the act may have constituted homicide by reckless negligence rather than justifiable self-defense.

---

## Significance / Notes
- This decision articulates a clear doctrine that a mistaken belief about the identity or intent of a purported aggressor can negate criminal liability for homicide if the mistake negates the required criminal intent and there is no negligence or bad faith.
- It reinforces the principle that self-defense remains a defense only when properly grounded in the presence of illegal aggression, reasonable necessity, and proportional response, and it acknowledges that an honest mistake of fact can shield a defendant from liability.
- The case is a foundational discussion in Philippine criminal law on the interaction between intention, mistake of fact, and the defense of self-defense, illustrating how the court balances the abstract requirements of criminal liability with the realities of fear, mistaken perception, and the duty to avoid unjust punishment.
