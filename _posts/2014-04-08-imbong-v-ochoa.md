## Case Title and Citation
James M. Imbong and Lovely-Ann C. Imbong, petitioners, v. Paquito N. Ochoa, Jr., Executive Secretary, et al.  
G.R. No. 204819, April 8, 2014  
Supreme Court - En Banc  
Ponente: Justice Mendoza

## Facts
- The petitions challenge Republic Act No. 10354, the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012 (RH Law), and related Implementing Rules and Regulations (RH-IRR).
- Fourteen petitions, with several intervenors, allege constitutional violations concerning the RH Law’s protection of life, health, religious freedom, family autonomy, free speech, privacy, and related rights.
- The Court had previously granted a Status Quo Ante Order (SQAO) to suspend enforcement of the RH Law and RH-IRR for 120 days (Mar. 19, 2013 to July 17, 2013), later extended.
- The Court held extensive hearings (July–August 2013) and issued a decision on April 8, 2014, partially granting the petitions and striking down specific provisions. The decision discusses the foundational constitutional protections of freedom of religion, life from conception, and the state’s interest in reproductive health, among other issues.
- The Court recognizes that population issues and maternal health are long-standing policy concerns and that prior laws (RA 4729, RA 5921, RA 6365, RA 9710) remain relevant. The majority emphasizes that RA 10354 must be read in light of these prior statutes and constitutional principles.

## Ruling
1. Yes — The Court may exercise judicial review over the RH Law and RH-IRR, recognizing the judiciary’s role to check grave abuse of discretion and to defend constitutional rights.  
2. Yes — There is an actual case/controversy ripe for adjudication given the law’s effect and enforcement mechanisms already in place.  
3. Yes — Facial challenges are permissible; a flexible approach is warranted where fundamental rights are at stake and there are questions of grave constitutional concern.  
4. Yes — Locus standi may be relaxed in matters of transcendental importance to permit public-interest challenges.  
5. Yes — The Court treats many petitions as petitions for prohibition under Rule 65, given the breadth and impact of the RH Law.  
6. Yes — The Court finds the RH Law not unconstitutional on the right to life of the unborn, framing life as beginning at fertilization and emphasizing the Constitution’s protection of life from conception.  
7. Yes — The Court finds the RH Law not unconstitutional on the right to health, recognizing constitutional duties to promote health and the regulatory framework safeguarding safety and efficacy of contraceptives; it declines to declare, at this stage, that all listed contraceptives are definitively non-abortifacient without FDA determinations.  
8. No — The RH Law is not unconstitutional in its entirety for religion or free speech; however, certain provisions infringing religious freedom and compelling objectors to refer or to comply with mandates were struck as unconstitutional or invalid.  
9. Yes — The RH Law does not violate the right to privacy in its core, but certain parental-consent and spousal-consent provisions were found problematic and were partially struck.  
10. Yes — The provision requiring pro bono services is not unconstitutional in itself, but certain coercive elements were narrowed; conscientious objectors are protected.  
11. Yes — Delegation to the FDA is permissible; the FDA remains the appropriate body to determine safety and non-abortifacient status of contraceptives and related supplies.  
12. Yes — Autonomy of LGUs/ARMM is not unduly invaded; national funding and coordination are consistent with constitutional structure.  
13. No — Academic freedom issues were not decided due to premature state of curriculum development and implementation plans.  
14. Yes — The Court upholds due process and equal protection principles, finding no impermissible or arbitrary classifications that would invalidate the Act as a whole.  
15. Yes — The Court upholds most of RA 10354 while striking down specific provisions that severely burden religious liberty or family autonomy.

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi
- Judicial review and separation of powers: The Court emphasizes Article VIII, Section 1 of the Constitution and its ongoing duty to settle actual controversies involving rights and to correct grave abuse of discretion by other branches (Tanada v. Angara; Magallona v. Ermita). The Court stresses it may review social legislation if Constitutional rights are implicated.  
- Procedural posture and ripeness: The Court notes that the RH Law has taken effect and budgetary actions have occurred, rendering the issues justiciable and ripe for review (Province of North Cotabato v. The Government of the Philippines; Tanada line of cases).  
- Facial challenge and fundamental rights: Drawing on US-law-inspired doctrine and Philippine practice, the Court accepts facial challenges where fundamental rights such as life, religion, and speech are implicated (US v. Salerno; Estrada v. Escritor; related Philippine jurisprudence).  
- Standing and transcendental importance: The Court recognizes the “transcendental importance” of reproductive health issues for society and relaxes standing requirements in public-interest cases (Coconut Oil Refineries v. Torres; Jaworski v. PAGCOR).  
- Right to life and life beginning at fertilization: The Court reviews constitutional text and the Constitutional Commission records to determine the framers’ intent; finds life begins at fertilization, reinforcing the prohibition on abortion and the protection of the fertilized ovum. It cites the Constitution’s Section 12, Article II and historical deliberations.  
- Right to health: The Court treats health as a self-executing constitutional right and upholds the government’s obligation to provide safe, accessible reproductive health care, while deferring to the FDA for safety determinations and to RA 4729/RA 5921 for preexisting safeguards ( Magna Carta for Women RA 9710; RA 4729; RA 5921).  
- Religious freedom and benevolent neutrality: The Court affirms the State’s duty to accommodate religious beliefs (Estrada v. Escritor; Islamic Da’wah Council) but applies a strict scrutiny-like approach to measures that burden religious exercise, especially the duty to refer or to provide information in certain contexts (Benevolent neutrality doctrine; Estrada; Escritor).  
- Involuntary servitude and pro bono service: The Court rejects the notion that requiring pro bono service equates to involuntary servitude, noting that Congress linked it to accreditation and public health goals, while preserving conscientious objectors’ rights.  
- Delegation to FDA: The Court upholds the delegation as constitutionally permissible given FDA’s expertise and statutory framework (Echagaray v. Justice; standard delegation jurisprudence).  
- Local autonomy: The Court finds no undue encroachment on LGU or ARMM autonomy, recognizing national priority programs while preserving local discretion, consistent with Local Government Code provisions (RA 7160) and related jurisprudence.  
- Due process, equal protection, and privacy: The Court concludes that the challenged provisions withstand due process and equal protection analyses, while addressing parental consent and spousal-consent concerns to preserve family integrity and privacy rights.  
- Academic freedom: The Court declines to rule on academic-freedom issues due to premature curriculum development, noting parallel Magna Carta for Women protections and the broader educational framework.

## Doctrine / Legal Principle
- Right to life starts at fertilization; protection of the unborn from conception.  
- Freedom of religion is protected; government accommodation of religious beliefs is required (benevolent neutrality).  
- Judicial review is available for constitutional challenges to legislative and executive actions.  
- Facial challenges to constitutional rights may be considered where fundamental rights are implicated.  
- FDA expertise governs safety/effectiveness of health products; delegation to FDA is constitutionally permissible.  
- One-subject/one-bill rule interpreted with flexibility; comprehensive statutes may combine related subject matters if related to a common objective.  
- Locus standi may be relaxed in cases of transcendental importance; public interest may permit standing beyond direct injury.  
- Due process and equal protection require reasonable classifications and protections for the underprivileged; distinctions must be substantial and germane to the law’s purpose.  
- Benevolent neutrality allows accommodation of religious beliefs while pursuing secular public health objectives.

## Disposition
- The petitions are PARTIALLY GRANTED. Republic Act No. 10354 is NOT UNCONSTITUTIONAL except to the following provisions, which are declared UNCONSTITUTIONAL to the extent indicated:
  1) Section 7 and corresponding RH-IRR provisions requiring private health facilities and non-maternity hospitals to refer patients (except in life-threatening cases) and allowing minor-parents access to modern methods without parental consent;  
  2) Section 23(a)(1) and the corresponding RH-IRR provision (Section 5.24) penalizing health-care providers for withholding or disseminating information on reproductive health without regard to a provider’s religious beliefs;  
  3) Section 23(a)(2)(i) and the RH-IRR to the extent they permit a married individual to undergo RH procedures without the spouse’s consent (except in life-threatening cases);  
  4) Section 23(a)(2)(ii) and the corresponding RH-IRR provision limiting parental consent to elective surgical procedures;  
  5) Section 23(a)(3) and the RH-IRR penalty for failing to refer a patient, except where conscientious objectors are involved;  
  6) Section 23(b) and corresponding RH-IRR penalizing public officers who hinder RH programs (to the extent noted);  
  7) Section 17 and the corresponding RH-IRR provision regarding pro bono RH services for PhilHealth accreditation; and  
  8) Section 3.01(a) and Section 3.01(g) of the RH-IRR adding the qualifier “primarily” to abortifacients/contraceptives (ultra vires).  
- The Status Quo Ante Order issued March 19, 2013, as extended, is lifted to the extent the above provisions have been declared constitutional, and remains in place to the extent of the provisions that were struck down.

## Significance / Notes
- Reaffirms the Constitution’s protection of life from conception and the State’s interest in reproductive health and population policy, while balancing religious freedom and autonomy of conscience.  
- Establishes that many provisions of RA 10354 may operate constitutionally with respect to life and health, but that certain coercive provisions infringing on religious freedom or parental/spousal autonomy must be struck.  
- Emphasizes that the FDA’s regulatory role is central to determining safe and non-abortifacient contraceptives; Congress cannot predetermine safety conclusions without FDA evaluation.  
- Highlights the Court’s approach to religious accommodation, upholding benevolent neutrality while allowing for conscientious objection, provided it does not unduly burden legitimate health objectives.  
- The decision clarifies the legal landscape for reproductive health policy in the Philippines, preserving the Magna Carta for Women’s framework and prioritizing health access for the poor, while safeguarding constitutional protections for life, religion, and family privacy.
