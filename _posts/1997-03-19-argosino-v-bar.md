## Case Title and Citation
Al Caparros Argosino, petitioner, vs. The Honorable Supreme Court, respondent.  
B.M. No. 712, March 19, 1997  
Manila En Banc  
---

## Facts
- Petitioner Al Caparros Argosino passed the bar examinations held in 1993; oath-taking was deferred due to a prior conviction for Reckless Imprudence Resulting In Homicide involving a fraternity death in September 1991.
- Eight accused initially pled not guilty to homicide; they later withdrew and pleaded guilty to reckless imprudence resulting in homicide. The trial court sentenced each to imprisonment ranging from two years four months and one day to four years.
- On June 18, 1993, the petitioner's probation was granted; on April 11, 1994, the probation officer recommended discharge, which occurred on April 14, 1994.
- On April 14, 1994, Argosino filed before the Court a petition to take the lawyer's oath based on discharge from probation.
- On July 13, 1995, the Court issued a resolution requiring evidence that Argosino complied with the good moral character standard for lawyers. He submitted fifteen certifications/letters from senators, trial judges, and members of religious orders, among others, and evidence of a scholarship foundation honoring the hazing victim.
- On September 26, 1995, Atty. Gilbert Camaligan, father of the victim, commented that he believed the act could be murder rather than homicide and that he was not in a position to state Argosino was morally fit, leaving the matter to the Court’s discretion. He expressed his forgiveness but emphasized ongoing pain and the stigma of the death.
- The Court acknowledged the pain of the loss and forgiveness, but conducted a careful evaluation of whether Argosino had purged himself of the moral deficiency. The Court noted the need to weigh youthfulness and rashness against moral fitness.
- After thorough review, the Court resolved to allow Argosino to take the lawyer's oath, to sign the Roll of Attorneys, and to practice, with explicit admonitions and expectations.

- The Court stressed that the oath is not a mere ceremony and that lawyers must weigh their actions against the oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility. It noted the general tendency of youth to be rash and uncalculating and took judicial notice of Argosino’s efforts to atone and contribute to the community.

3. Yes — The Court allowed Argosino to take the lawyer's oath, with admonitions and conditions, on a date to be set by the Court.

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi
- The Court reaffirmed that admission to the practice of law requires strict moral character but recognized that moral fitness can be achieved through genuine rehabilitation and community service.
- It acknowledged the trauma to the victim’s family and the forgiveness expressed, yet emphasized that forgiveness alone does not automatically resolve moral fitness concerns.
- In a prior July 13, 1995 resolution, the Court stated it was prepared to consider de novo whether Argosino had purged the deficiency in moral character; the Court applied that framework.
- The Court weighed multiple certifications and testimonies, including endorsements from public officials and religious members, and noted Argosino’s involvement in atonement efforts, such as establishing a scholarship in memory of the victim.
- The Court emphasized that the oath to be taken is a solemn commitment to the profession, and the admission decision sought to balance public interest in assuring qualified practitioners with recognition of rehabilitation.

- The decision cites the need to weigh youthfulness and rash behavior against the long-term integrity required of the legal profession, and it relies on the principle that the Court may grant admission after due consideration of evidence and with appropriate admonitions.

## Doctrine / Legal Principle
- Moral character as a condition for admission to the bar, subject to de novo review of rehabilitation and evidence of good character.
- The Court may consider evidence of reform, community service, and endorsements in determining fitness for admission.
- The lawyer’s oath is a solemn, binding commitment; admission may be conditioned or delayed if concerns about character persist, but may be granted with admonitions when justified.
- The judiciary may exercise discretion in admission decisions to balance individual rehabilitation with public confidence in the legal profession.
- Prior probation and penalties do not necessarily bar admission if there is clear evidence of purged moral deficiency.

---

## Disposition
- The petition is GRANTED in part. Argosino is allowed to take the lawyer's oath on a date set by the Court, to sign the Roll of Attorneys, and to practice the legal profession, subject to admonitions and continued monitoring.

## Concurring / Dissenting Opinions
- None stated; the decision is issued by the Manila En Banc with concurrence from all Justices referenced.

## Significance / Notes

- Highlights the Court’s willingness to consider de novo evaluations of character when new evidence or circumstances arise.
