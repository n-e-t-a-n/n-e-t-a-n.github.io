## Case Title and Citation
Felixberto A. Abellana, petitioner, vs. People of the Philippines and Spouses Saapia B. Alonto and Diaga Alonto, respondents.  
G.R. No. 174654, August 17, 2011  
Supreme Court - First Division  
Ponente: Justice Mariano C. Del Castillo

## Facts
- In 1985, petitioner extended a loan to spouses Diaga and Saapia Alonto, secured by a Deed of Real Estate Mortgage over Lot Nos. 6471 and 6472 in Cebu City.
- In 1987, petitioner prepared a Deed of Absolute Sale conveying those lots to him; the Deed was signed by the spouses in Manila but notarized in Cebu City allegedly without the spouses appearing before the notary.
- Petitioner then caused the transfer of titles to his name and subsequently sold the lots to third persons.
- On August 12, 1999, an Information was filed charging petitioner with Estafa through Falsification of a Public Document, alleging that the Deed of Absolute Sale was falsified by imitating the signatures of the spouses and that the transaction facilitated the transfer of title to petitioner.
- At arraignment, petitioner pleaded not guilty. Trial proceeded.
- RTC Decision (May 21, 2003): The court found petitioner did not intend to defraud the spouses; the Deed of Absolute Sale was signed by the spouses, though notarization occurred without their appearance. The RTC convicted petitioner of Falsification of a Public Document by a private individual (Art. 172 in relation to Art. 171(2)) rather than Estafa through Falsification. It ordered reconveyance of the properties, return of ₱130,000, and various damages and costs.
- CA Decision (February 22, 2006): The Court of Appeals set aside the RTC verdict insofar as it convicted petitioner of a crime different from or not included in the Information (i.e., convicted for falsification rather than estafa through falsification). The CA affirmed civil liability against petitioner.
- Petitioner filed a petition for review, contending he could not be civilly liable following acquittal.

## Issues
1. May the petitioner be civilly liable notwithstanding his acquittal of the criminal charge?

---

## Ruling
1. No — civil liability cannot be sustained based on the criminal acts when, as here, there is no basis for damages; the civil liability imposed by the CA was deleted for lack of factual and legal basis.

---

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi
- Civil liability arises from one's own act or omission that damages another, independently of criminal culpability; however, there must be proven damage and a basis in fact and law.
- The CA’s civil liability against Abellana was based on reconveyance and damages tied to the same transaction, but the Supreme Court found no proof of damage: the trial court had found the signatures genuine and the notarization defect did not automatically invalidate the deed.
- The notarization defect does not ipso facto void the contract or erase the transfer; without clear and convincing evidence of falsity or damage, reconveyance and damages cannot be imposed.
- Citing Banal v. Tadeo, Jr., civil liability exists when the act causes damage; but when the evidence shows no damage, the civil liability lacks basis.
- Once the civil liability is grounded on facts not proven, it cannot be sustained even if the criminal conviction is set aside or acquitted; civil liability does not automatically arise from a criminal acquittal absent proof of damage.

---

## Doctrine / Legal Principle
- Civil liability arises from one's act or omission that causes damage, regardless of criminal liability.
- Extinction of a penal action does not automatically extinguish civil liability; civil liability requires a showing of damage caused by the act.
- An acquittal on a criminal charge does not automatically justify civil liability; the civil action must be proven on its own merits, particularly showing damage.
- Notarization defects do not automatically invalidate a deed or void a transfer; absence of appearance before the notary does not, by itself, prove falsity or damage.

---

## Disposition
- The petition is GRANTED. The February 22, 2006 decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED insofar as it set aside the conviction for the crime of falsification of a public document. The portion affirming civil liabilities (restoration of ownership, payment of ₱1,103,000, and related damages and fees) is deleted for lack of factual and legal basis. The civil liability is not upheld; petitioner is not liable for reconveyance or damages.

## Concurring / Dissenting Opinions
- None stated; the decision reflects the joined opinion of the Court with no separate concurring or dissenting opinions.

---

## Significance / Notes
- Clarifies that civil liability in criminal cases requires independent proof of damage; acquittal on the criminal charge does not automatically foreclose civil liability, but civil liability cannot be imposed absent evidence of damage.
- Affirms that procedural flaws in notarization do not automatically nullify a deed or create a damages remedy without demonstrated harm.
- Emphasizes the need for factual and legal basis to impose civil sanctions arising from criminal acts, and that courts should not impose civil penalties without clear support in the record.
