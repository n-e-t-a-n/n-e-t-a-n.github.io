## Case Title and Citation
Felixberto A. Abellana, petitioner, vs. People of the Philippines and Spouses Saapia B. Alonto and Diaga Alonto, Respondents.  
G.R. No. 174654, August 17, 2011  
Supreme Court - First Division  
Ponente: Justice Del Castillo

---

## Facts
- In 1985, petitioner extended a loan to spouses Diaga and Saapia Alonto, secured by a Deed of Real Estate Mortgage over Lot Nos. 6471 and 6472 in Cebu City.
- In 1987, petitioner prepared a Deed of Absolute Sale conveying the lots to him. The Deed was signed by the spouses in Manila but notarized in Cebu City allegedly without the spouses appearing before the notary public.
- Thereafter, petitioner caused the titles to be transferred to his name and sold the lots to third persons.
- On August 12, 1999, an Information was filed charging petitioner with Estafa through Falsification of Public Document, alleging that on July 9, 1987, in Cebu City, he falsified a Deed of Absolute Sale before Notary Gines N. Abellana by imitating signatures of the spouses, causing the transfer of titles to his name and the loss of ₱130,000.00.
- At arraignment, petitioner pleaded not guilty. Trial followed.
- The RTC, in a May 21, 2003 decision, found that petitioner did not intend to defraud the Alontos; the Deed of Absolute Sale was signed by the spouses and notarized without their personal appearance. It convicted petitioner of Falsification of a Public Document by a private individual under Article 172 in relation to Article 171, and imposed a sentence and reconveyance orders.
- On appeal, the CA, in a February 22, 2006 decision, set aside the conviction for a crime different from the one charged (estafa through falsification) but affirmed the civil liability against petitioner.
- A motion for reconsideration was denied by the CA on August 15, 2006.
- The petition before the Supreme Court challenged the civil liability despite acquittal and sought review of the CA decision.

## Issues
1. Could petitioner be held civilly liable notwithstanding his acquittal on the criminal charge of estafa through falsification of public document?

---

## Ruling
1. Yes — civil liability may attach despite acquittal on the criminal charge; however, in this case the Civil Liability portion imposed by the Court of Appeals was deleted for lack of factual and legal basis.

---

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi
- An acquittal does not automatically extinguish civil liability arising from the same act if it caused damage; the rule requires a determination whether the act or omission from which civil liability might arise existed and caused damage.
- The Court rejected the CA’s approach that civil liability could stand solely because the criminal conviction was for a different offense; instead, it held that civil liability must be grounded in proof of damage resulting from the act.
- In this case, the Court emphasized that:
  - The information charged estafa through falsification, but the RTC found no intent to defraud; the Deed of Absolute Sale was signed by the spouses and not forged, and notarization did not by itself void the transaction.
  - The CA’s affirmation of civil liability relied on the premises that damage occurred and that reconveyance and damages should be awarded; the Court found no sufficient evidence of damage to support civil liability.
  - The civil liability cannot be imposed where there is no factual basis showing damage, and the trial court’s imposition of reconveyance and monetary damages lacked support.
- The decision cites the principle that civil liability arises from one’s own act or omission causing damage, citing Banal v. Tadeo and related remedial-law principles; extinction of penal action does not automatically extinguish civil liability unless a final judgment expressly states that the fact giving rise to civil liability did not exist.
- Statutory references: Article 172 (Falsification by private individuals) and Article 171 (Falsification by public officer or notary), to distinguish the alleged acts from actual findings of damage.

## Doctrine / Legal Principle
- Civil liability can arise independently from criminal liability when the actor’s acts caused damage to another.
- Extinction of the penal action does not automatically extinguish civil liability unless a final judgment explicitly states that the fact giving rise to civil liability did not exist.
- Notarization irregularities do not automatically void a deed; the deed may retain validity unless proven otherwise, and civil liability requires proof of actual damage.
- Civil liability should not be imposed in the absence of a factual and legal basis; sentences should not be given in the alternative without proper basis.
- The decision restates the principle that civil liability is grounded in the obligation to repair or make whole the damage caused by one’s act or omission.

---

## Disposition
- The petition is GRANTED.
- The February 22, 2006 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 78644 is AFFIRMED insofar as it set aside the conviction for the crime of falsification of public document.
- The portion of the CA decision that affirmed civil liabilities on the petitioner (restoration of ownership and possession, payment of ₱1,103,000, and related damages/fees) is deleted for lack of factual and legal basis.
- The case is remanded with the conviction reversed; no civil liability award remains against the petitioner based on the record.

## Significance / Notes
- The ruling clarifies that civil liability in criminal cases is distinct from the penal outcome and may be foreclosed absent proof of damage; acquittal does not automatically erase civil obligations if damages are shown.
- It reinforces that civil liability requires independent factual and legal basis, even where the criminal conviction is set aside or altered.
- The decision highlights that procedural niceties (e.g., notarization anomalies) do not, by themselves, create civil liability absent demonstrable damage.
- It provides guidance on the boundaries of reconveyance and monetary damages in cases involving alleged falsification, emphasizing the need for a clear evidentiary showing of damage.
