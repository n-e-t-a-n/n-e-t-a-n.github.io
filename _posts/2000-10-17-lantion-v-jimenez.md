## Facts
- On January 18, 2000, by a vote of 9-6, the Court dismissed the petition and ordered the petitioner to furnish the private respondent copies of the extradition request and its supporting papers, with a reasonable period to file his comment with supporting evidence. 2000-01-18
- On 2000-02-03, the petitioner timely filed an Urgent Motion for Reconsideration challenging the ruling. 2000-02-03
- A series of pleadings followed: a 58-page Comment by private respondent (2000-03-28) opposing the motion; the petitioner’s 2000-04-05 Urgent Motion to Allow Continuation and Maintenance of Action and Filing of Reply; a 2000-06-07 Manifestation with embassy notes and government notes; 2000-08-15 private respondent’s Manifestation and Motion for Leave to File Rejoinder; 2000-08-18 private respondent’s Motion to Expunge the petitioner’s Manifestation.  
- Except for the Motion to Allow Continuation and Maintenance of Action, pending motions were denied. The central issue was whether the private respondent was entitled to notice and hearing during the extradition evaluation stage.  
- The Court held that the private respondent is not entitled to the right to notice and hearing during the evaluation stage of the extradition process, citing the RP-US Extradition Treaty and PD No. 1069, which contemplate notice and hearing after filing of the petition in the extradition court, not during the evaluation phase.  
- The majority emphasized the treaty's intent to prevent flight and to expedite extradition, and noted that international practice (as communicated through notes from Canada and Hong Kong) does not provide for an extraditee’s pre-petition notice and hearing. 2000-01-18 to 2000-08-18

## Issues
1. Did private respondent have a due process right to notice and hearing during the evaluation stage of the extradition process?

---

## Ruling
1. No — The private respondent is not entitled to notice and hearing during the evaluation stage of the extradition process. The RP-US Extradition Treaty and PD No. 1069 do not grant such a right; extradition is sui generis, and the due process required is tailored to the administrative evaluation phase, not a criminal-prosecution-like proceeding.

---

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi
- The RP-US Extradition Treaty and PD No. 1069 do not provide a right to demand copies of the extradition request and its supporting documents for comment while the request is still under evaluation. Treaties cannot be altered by equity. The treaty’s interpretive intent supports minimizing the extraditee’s opportunities to flee by withholding pre-petition details. 2000-01-18
- Treaties must be interpreted in light of their object and purpose, per the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The preambles to PD No. 1069 emphasize international cooperation to suppress crime and expedite punishment, which supports minimizing premature disclosure that could enable flight. 2000-01-18
- The executive branch’s interpretation of the treaty should be given weight, as treaties are joint executive-legislative acts. The DFA and DOJ have maintained that the private respondent does not have a right to notice and hearing during the evaluation stage. 2000-01-18
- Other jurisdictions and neighboring jurisdictions (Canada, Hong Kong) indicated that it is not international practice to provide a potential extraditee with copies of extradition papers during evaluation. This convergence supports the Court’s position. 2000-01-18
- An extradition proceeding is sui generis and not a criminal prosecution; thus constitutional rights associated with a criminal trial are not automatically applicable during the evaluation stage. The evidence standard and procedural safeguards differ from those in criminal cases. 2000-01-18
- Because provisional arrest provisions may be invoked, and because the extradition process aims to avoid flight and foreign-relations concerns, withholding notice and hearing during evaluation is consistent with the balance of interests at this stage. 2000-01-18
- The majority emphasized that procedural due process must be considered in light of the government’s needs and the context, with the preference for immediate surrender when warranted by treaty obligations, rather than extending pre-petition rights. 2000-01-18

## Doctrine / Legal Principle
- Treaties are interpreted in light of their object and purpose; executive interpretations are given substantial weight. 
- Extradition proceedings are sui generis and distinct from criminal prosecutions; the right to notice and hearing is not automatically extended to the evaluation stage.
- Due process is flexible and context-dependent; not all governmental actions require identical procedures.
- The need to prevent flight and to expedite international cooperation can justify limiting pre-petition rights during evaluation.
- Provisional arrest provisions and related safeguards operate within the framework of treaty obligations and domestic implementing law.

---

## Disposition
- The Urgent Motion for Reconsideration is GRANTED.
- The Decision in the case, promulgated on January 18, 2000, is REVERSED.
- The assailed Order issued by the public respondent judge on August 9, 1999 is SET ASIDE.
- The temporary restraining order issued by this Court on August 17, 1999 is made PERMANENT.
- The Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 25 is enjoined from conducting further proceedings in Civil Case No. 99-94684.

## Concurring / Dissenting Opinions
- Dissent by Justice Melo (separately objecting to the majority’s ruling on due process and the extent of rights during the evaluation stage).
- Dissent by Justice YnareSantiago (separate dissent, arguing for greater protection of due process rights and for granting access to the charges earlier in the process; joined by some justices in various forms).
- Additional concurring/dissenting opinions were noted by several justices (e.g., Justices Vitug, Quisumbing, Buena) in varying degrees, as indicated in the decision's footnotes and statements appended to the dissent.

## Significance / Notes
- Establishes that, in the Philippines, the evaluation stage of extradition requests does not automatically trigger constitutional due process rights to notice and hearing.
- Reinforces the executive branch's role in foreign relations and treaty implementation, with substantial deference to the interpretations of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Department of Justice.
- Highlights the balance of interests between individual liberty and international cooperation in the context of extradition, and clarifies that procedural protections may be tailored to the stage of the process.
- Underlines the interplay between domestic law (Presidential Decree No. 1069) and international treaties in shaping procedural rights during extradition proceedings.
