## Case Title and Citation
Philippine Lawyers Association, petitioner, vs. Celedonio Agrava, in his capacity as Director of the Philippines Patent Office, respondent.  
G.R. No. L-12426, February 16, 1959  
Supreme Court - En Banc  
Ponente: Justice Montemayor

## Facts
- On May 27, 1957, respondent Director issued a circular announcing an examination scheduled for June 27, 1957 to determine who are qualified to practice as patent attorneys before the Philippines Patent Office; the examination covered patent law, jurisprudence, and the rules of practice before the Office; the circular stated that members of the Philippine Bar, engineers, and other persons with sufficient scientific training could take the examination; the Director had previously held similar examinations.
- The Philippine Lawyer's Association contends that a person who has passed the bar examinations and is licensed to practice law in the Philippines, and is in good standing, is qualified to practice before the Patent Office; therefore, the practice of requiring bar members to take and pass an examination as a condition to practice before the Patent Office exceeds the Director's jurisdiction and violates the law.
- The Director, through the Solicitor General, maintains that patent prosecution involves both law and technical knowledge and may be handled by lawyers, engineers, or others with sufficient training who pass the Patent Office's examination; he argues that the Rules of Court do not prohibit a quasi-judicial body from requiring additional qualifications; he asserts that Republic Act No. 165 (Patent Law) authorizes actions akin to those in the United States patent system; he contends that the Director may require examinations under RA 165 and cites various sections and analogous U.S. practice.
- The case centers on whether the Director may require bar members to pass an examination to practice before the Patent Office, and whether such authority is provided by the Patent Law or other law; the petition seeks prohibition against such examination.

## Issues
1. Did the Director of Patents have the authority to require members of the Philippine Bar in good standing to take and pass an examination as a condition to practice before the Philippines Patent Office?
2. Is such authority to require an examination authorized by Republic Act No. 165 (the Patent Law) or by other provisions of law?

---

## Ruling
1. No — The Director of Patents did not have authority to require members of the Philippine Bar in good standing to pass an examination as a condition to practice before the Patent Office; the petition for prohibition is granted.
2. No — There is no express provision in Republic Act No. 165 granting authority to require such examinations; the Patent Office may not impose the examination requirement on members of the bar to practice before it.

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi
- The Supreme Court holds that the practice of law includes appearances before the Patent Office, the representation of applicants, and the prosecution of patent applications, which involves interpretation and application of laws and legal principles, as well as evidence and procedure.
- The admission to the practice of law in the Philippines is a function of the Supreme Court, and a member in good standing may practice before any judicial or quasi-judicial or administrative body; the Patent Office’s decisions are subject to appeal to the Supreme Court under RA 165.
- While patent cases require technical knowledge, the practice of law encompasses more than purely technical work and includes drafting and preparing papers and legal instruments; thus, a bar member may practice before the Patent Office without a formal additional examination.
- Republic Act No. 165, Section 78, grants authority to promulgate rules and regulations for the conduct of business in the Patent Office but does not expressly authorize the Director to require an examination of lawyers in order to practice before the Patent Office; the U.S. Patent Office analogy cited by the Director does not control the Philippines, and there is no equivalent express authorization in the Philippine statute.
- The Court notes that allowing such an examination could lead to similar requirements by other bureaus and would undermine the right of the bar to practice before administrative and quasi-judicial bodies; the appeal mechanism to the Supreme Court (Section 61) supports that patent-office decisions remain within judicial review.

---

## Doctrine / Legal Principle
- The practice of law includes representations before administrative and quasi-judicial bodies, not merely courtroom advocacy.
- The Supreme Court holds exclusive authority over admission to the practice of law; a member in good standing may practice before the Patent Office where the function involves legal interpretation and procedural issues.
- Absence of express statutory authorization in the Patent Law (RA 165) to impose examinations on lawyers before the Patent Office; and reliance on similar foreign statutes (e.g., U.S. patent law) does not substitute for local statutory authorization.
- Appeals from patent-office decisions lie to the Supreme Court; any rule restricting bar members’ access to practice before the Patent Office should be grounded in clear statutory authority.

---

## Disposition
- The petition for prohibition is granted.
- The respondent Director is prohibited from requiring members of the Philippine Bar to submit to an examination or to pass the same before being permitted to appear and practice before the Patent Office.
- No costs.

---

## Concurring / Dissenting Opinions
- No separate concurring or dissenting opinions were issued; the decision reflects a unanimous conclusion with the Chief and other Justices concurring in the result.

---

## Significance / Notes
- Establishes that the practice of law before the Patent Office is within the scope of the bar and may not be conditioned on an extra examination.
- Clarifies that RA 165 does not authorize the Director of Patents to impose new qualifications for lawyers beyond those already required for bar admission.
- Highlights the boundary between regulatory authority of a patent office and the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court over admission to the practice of law.
- Serves as a precedent regarding the roles of professional regulation and the reviewability of agency actions in the Philippines.
