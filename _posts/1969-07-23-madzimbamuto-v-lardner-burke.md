## Facts
- Southern Rhodesia was annexed by the Crown in 1923 and granted a Constitution in 1961, which vested executive authority in Her Majesty through the Governor and provided for a legislature with limited self-government.  
- On November 5, 1965, the Governor lawfully proclaimed a state of emergency, and under emergency regulations, Daniel Nyamayaro Madzimbamuto, the appellant’s husband, was detained.  
- On November 11, 1965, the Rhodesian Prime Minister and Cabinet issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI), declaring Rhodesia independent. The Governor declared this unconstitutional, dismissing the Ministers and instructing the judiciary and public to continue with lawful duties.  
- The United Kingdom responded with the Southern Rhodesia Act, 1965, affirming Rhodesia remained under British sovereignty, and an Order in Council suspending legislative and executive powers in Rhodesia.  
- Despite this, the rebel government continued, promulgating a new constitution in 1965 and renewing emergency regulations under which Madzimbamuto remained detained after February 4, 1966.  
- Rhodesian courts (General Division and Appellate Division) held the rebel regime unlawful but gave effect to its regulations under the doctrine of necessity. The Appellate Division partially allowed the appeal but upheld detention under later regulations.  
- Stella Madzimbamuto appealed to the Privy Council, challenging the validity of the emergency regulations and her husband’s detention.

## Issues
1. Did Stella Madzimbamuto have the right to appeal to the Privy Council under the 1961 Constitution?  
2. Did the Southern Rhodesia Act, 1965, and the Constitution Order, 1965, have full legal effect in Rhodesia despite the UDI?  
3. Could the rebel government be regarded as a lawful or de facto government whose acts had legal effect?  
4. Could the doctrine of necessity validate emergency regulations of the rebel regime?  
5. Was Daniel Madzimbamuto’s continued detention lawful after February 4, 1966?

## Ruling
1. Yes — She had the right of appeal as an “aggrieved” person under section 71 (5) of the 1961 Constitution.  
2. Yes — The UK Parliament retained full sovereignty, and its legislation and Orders in Council were binding in Rhodesia.  
3. No — The rebel regime could not be recognised as lawful; international law concepts of de facto governments did not apply in this context.  
4. No (majority) — The doctrine of necessity could not override lawful UK legislation. (Lord Pearce dissenting — necessity could validate certain acts for orderly governance.)  
5. No — The detention after February 4, 1966, was unlawful because the emergency regulations of the rebel regime were void.

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi
- The Privy Council emphasized that sovereignty over Southern Rhodesia remained with the UK Parliament since annexation in 1923. The 1961 Constitution did not confer sovereignty but only limited self-government.  
- The Southern Rhodesia Act, 1965, and Constitution Order lawfully suspended the legislative assembly and executive powers, rendering the rebel constitution and subsequent acts void.  
- Courts could not recognise acts of a rebel regime in defiance of lawful authority. Recognition doctrines in international law applied only to foreign states, not to insurrections within a British colony.  
- The Statute of Treason, 1495, did not compel allegiance to the usurping Rhodesian government.  
- Judicial duty required adherence to lawful constitutional authority, not pragmatic compliance with political realities.  
- Lord Pearce, dissenting, argued for recognition of certain acts of the illegal regime under necessity to preserve law and order, provided they did not impair constitutional rights or further the usurpation.

## Doctrine / Legal Principle
- Sovereignty over a colony remains with the UK Parliament unless lawfully altered.  
- The doctrine of necessity cannot legitimise acts contrary to statutes enacted by the lawful sovereign.  
- Courts in a colony cannot recognise the acts of an unlawful usurping government.  
- Judicial duty is to uphold constitutional law, not to validate political realities.  

---

## Disposition
The Privy Council allowed the appeal. The emergency regulations and detention order under which Daniel Madzimbamuto was held were declared invalid. The rebel regime’s constitution and legislative acts were held void.

---

## Concurring / Dissenting Opinions
- Majority: Lords Reid, Morris, Wilberforce, Pearson — detention unlawful; no recognition of rebel regime acts.  
- Dissent: Lord Pearce — doctrine of necessity required limited recognition of acts necessary for orderly governance.

---

## Significance / Notes
- Reaffirmed UK Parliament’s supremacy over colonies and denied legal recognition to unilateral declarations of independence.  
- Strengthened judicial duty to uphold lawful sovereignty even under pressure from usurping regimes.  
- Set precedent that necessity cannot justify recognition of unconstitutional regimes when lawful authority persists.  
- Highlighted tension between political realities and strict constitutional law during colonial crises.
