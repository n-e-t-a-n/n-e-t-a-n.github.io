Ponente: Justice Malcolm

## Facts
- Petitioners were Manguianes (Mangyans) of Mindoro who alleged they were being held against their will on a reservation established at Tigbao, Lake Naujan; one named Doroteo Dabalos was said to be detained in Calapan for having run away from the reservation.
- On February 1, 1917 the Provincial Board of Mindoro adopted Resolution No. 25 selecting about 800 hectares in the sitio of Tigbao, Lake Naujan, as a site for permanent settlement of Mangyanes, subject to approval by the Secretary of the Interior.
- The Secretary of the Interior approved the provincial resolution on February 21, 1917.
- On December 4, 1917 the provincial governor issued Executive Order No. 2 directing all Mangyans in specified townships and districts to take up habitation at Tigbao not later than December 31, 1917, and stating that any Mangyan refusing to comply would upon conviction be imprisoned for not exceeding sixty days, citing section 2145 and section 2759 of the Administrative Code (Act No. 2711).
- Section 2145 (Administrative Code of 1917) authorizes, with prior approval of the Department Head, the provincial governor of a province in which non-Christian inhabitants are found, when deemed necessary in the interest of law and order, to direct such inhabitants to take up habitation on sites on unoccupied public lands selected by him and approved by the provincial board.
- Section 2759 prescribes punishment (imprisonment not exceeding sixty days) for non-Christians who refuse to comply with directions given under section 2145.
- The Solicitor-General's return defended the adoption and enforcement of section 2145, argued it derived from prior statutes (e.g., Act No. 547) and from longstanding administrative practice, and asserted the measures were adopted for the protection and advancement (civilizing) of the Mangyans and the protection of public forests.

## Issues
1. Does section 2145 of the Administrative Code unlawfully delegate legislative power to provincial authorities?
2. Does section 2145 constitute unconstitutional religious discrimination by segregating persons because they are "non-Christian"?
3. Does enforcement of section 2145 deprive petitioners of life, liberty, or property without due process of law or deny equal protection of the laws?
4. Does confinement on a reservation under section 2145 constitute slavery or involuntary servitude in violation of the Organic Law provisions forbidding slavery and involuntary servitude?
5. Are the petitioners unlawfully imprisoned such that habeas corpus must issue?

---

## Ruling
1. No - The statute does not unlawfully delegate legislative power; it confers authority to execute and apply legislative policy on local authorities with prescribed limits and supervision.
2. No - The term "non-Christian" is construed to denote degree of civilization (uncivilized or semi-nomadic inhabitants), not religious belief, and therefore the statute does not discriminate on the basis of religion.
3. No - Enforcement of section 2145 is a reasonable exercise of the police power, enacted and executed with due process safeguards and with a legitimate classification; it does not deprive petitioners of due process or equal protection.
4. No - Confinement pursuant to section 2145 does not amount to slavery or involuntary servitude as prohibited by the Organic Law; the order to reside on the reservation is not a condition of enforced labor for another.
5. No - Petitioners are not unlawfully imprisoned; habeas corpus will not issue and the petition is denied.

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi
- Historical and statutory context:
  1. The Court reviewed the lineage of section 2145 through earlier statutes (e.g., Act No. 547) and administrative practice dating to Spanish and American colonial policies toward uncivilized or tribal populations, and the establishment of the Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes. The legislative and executive records demonstrate a consistent policy of concentrating semi-nomadic tribes in settlements for purposes of education, public order, and development.
- Delegation of legislative power:
  1. The nondelegation principle prohibits delegating the power to make law, but permits conferring discretion to executive or local authorities to execute law within standards and limits set by the Legislature. Section 2145 vests executional discretion in provincial officials subject to approval by a Department Head and the provincial board; this is a permissible delegation where local knowledge and administration are necessary (citing precedent on permissible delegation and administrative discretion).
- Meaning of "non-Christian":
  1. The Court examined statutory usage, administrative interpretations (letters and circulars of the Secretary of the Interior and Collectors), census classifications, and prior judicial references, concluding that "non-Christian" in the statutory framework denotes mode of life and degree of civilization (tribal, semi-nomadic), not merely religious affiliation. Treating the term otherwise would raise religious-freedom problems and contradict administrative practice.
- Due process and equal protection:
  1. The Court applied the familiar tests: (a) existence of a legislative enactment; (b) reasonableness of the law's operation; (c) enforcement by prescribed procedures; (d) applicability to a definable class. Section 2145 met these criteria as a valid exercise of the police power to promote health, order, education, and development. The Court analogized to U.S. precedents recognizing plenary legislative and executive authority over dependent tribal communities (e.g., Worcester, U.S. v. Kagama, U.S. v. Sandoval) and cited Yick Wo for the principle that classifications must be reasonable. The Court concluded the classification was rationally related to the legitimate governmental objective of civilizing and protecting backward populations and public resources.
- Slavery and involuntary servitude:
  1. The Court construed the Organic Law prohibitions against slavery and involuntary servitude narrowly: confinement under section 2145 does not impose compulsory labor for another; the Mangyans on the reservation worked for themselves and were subject to relocation requirements aimed at settlement and protection rather than forced servitude.
- Final appraisal and policy deference:
  1. Given the settled administrative and legislative policy toward non-Christian tribes, the Court emphasized deference to the legislative and executive branches in sociopolitical matters of this character, and declined to substitute judicial judgment for the coordinated policy choice of those branches. The Court therefore held section 2145 constitutional and denied habeas relief.

Statutes, rules and cases relied upon or discussed in the opinion include:
- Administrative Code of 1917, secs. 2145 and 2759.
- Act No. 547 (Special Provincial Government Act re Manguianes).
- United States precedents: Worcester v. Georgia; United States v. Kagama; United States v. Sandoval; United States v. Crook; West v. Hitchcock; Jacobson v. Massachusetts; Yick Wo v. Hopkins.
- Administrative interpretations and circulars of the Secretary of the Interior and the Collector of Internal Revenue (as recited in the opinion).

## Doctrine / Legal Principle
- The term "non-Christian" in the Philippine statutory and administrative context is a cultural/classification term referring to degree of civilization (tribal, semi-nomadic status), not a religiously based classification.
- The Legislature may vest executing authorities (provincial governor and provincial board, with departmental approval) with discretionary powers to carry out policies concerning locally situated, uncivilized populations, provided statutory standards and supervision exist.
- The police power permits reasonable restraints on liberty, including directed settlement of semi-nomadic populations, when measures are rationally related to public welfare objectives (education, public order, protection of resources).
- Judicial review is restrained where a consistent legislative-executive policy addressing dependent tribal communities is in place; courts will defer absent clear constitutional violation.
- Confinement to a reservation pursuant to a valid statute does not automatically constitute slavery or involuntary servitude if it does not impose compulsory labor for another.

---

## Disposition
- The writ of habeas corpus was denied.
- The Court held section 2145 of the Administrative Code of 1917 constitutional and concluded petitioners were not unlawfully imprisoned or restrained of their liberty under that section.
- Costs were taxed against petitioners.

## Concurring / Dissenting Opinions
- Concurring: Justice Carson concurred, agreeing with the majority's interpretation of "non-Christian" as referring to degree of civilization and endorsing the administrative tests (mode of life, degree of advancement, connection with civilized communities).
- Dissenting: Justices Johnson and Moir dissented.
  - Justice Johnson: Emphasized that petitioners were deprived of liberty without a hearing; asserted all persons are entitled to at least a hearing before deprivation of liberty.
  - Justice Moir: Argued sections 2145 and 2759 deprive Manguianes of liberty without due process, pose grave risks of arbitrary governmental power and involuntary servitude, and are unconstitutional; warned against authorizing broad provincial discretion to confine citizens without judicial safeguards.
- Chief Justice Arellano, and Justices Torres and Avanceña, joined the majority opinion.

## Significance / Notes
- The decision upholds a wide administrative and legislative authority to direct settlement of semi-nomadic indigenous populations, aligning Philippine policy toward non-Christian tribes with an approach analogous to historical U.S. Indian policy.
- It establishes that statutory labels such as "non-Christian" may be interpreted in light of legislative history and administrative practice to denote socio-cultural status rather than religious affiliation, avoiding constitutional religious-discrimination issues.
- The ruling affirms broad police-power discretion to enact preventive and developmental measures (settlement, schooling, protection of resources) targeted at backward populations, subject to legislative standards and departmental oversight.
- The case illustrates judicial deference to coordinated legislative-executive programs addressing sociological and developmental policy, limiting the scope of habeas corpus and other judicial remedies where no specific abuse of authority is shown.
- Practical effect: provincial governors, with departmental approval, may lawfully direct designated tribal populations to specified public land sites for settlements; refusal to comply may be penalized under section 2759; potential for administrative remedies and future judicial review remains if specific abuses or constitutional violations are demonstrated.
