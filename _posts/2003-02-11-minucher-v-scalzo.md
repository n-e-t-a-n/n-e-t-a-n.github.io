## Facts

- In May 1986 a buy-bust operation at petitioner Khosrow Minucher's residence resulted in the seizure of heroin; an Information for violation of Section 4 of R.A. No. 6425 was filed against Minucher and Abbas Torabian in the RTC of Pasig.  
- The police narcotics agents were accompanied by Arthur Scalzo, who later became a principal prosecution witness.  
- On January 8, 1988, the criminal court acquitted Minucher and Torabian.  
- On August 3, 1988, Minucher filed Civil Case No. 88-45691 in the RTC, Manila, claiming damages for alleged trumped-up drug charges and wrongful arrest and seizure instigated by Scalzo. The complaint alleged, among other things, forcible entry, handcuffing, detention, publicity as an international drug trafficker, and loss of property and valuables.
- Scalzo initially made special appearances and filed motions, including motions for extension to file an answer and a motion to quash summons; the trial court found these constituted voluntary appearances and denied the motion to quash.
- Scalzo later asserted, by motion to dismiss (filed June 14, 1990), that he was entitled to diplomatic immunity and submitted several diplomatic notes and certifications from the U.S. Embassy and Department of Foreign Affairs (Exhs. 1–8) and DEA documents (Exhs. 9–13).
- The trial court denied the motion to dismiss. Scalzo petitioned the Court of Appeals and the CA, in CA-G.R. SP No. 22505, sustained diplomatic immunity and ordered dismissal.  
- Minucher obtained a reversal in this Court in G.R. No. 97765 (214 SCRA 242) in September 1992, on grounds that the CA erred by dismissing without resolving authenticity of the diplomatic note and without considering evidence that acts were done in a personal capacity. The case was remanded for trial.
- The RTC, Manila, rendered judgment for Minucher on November 17, 1995, awarding actual, moral, exemplary damages and attorney's fees.
- On appeal the Court of Appeals reversed the RTC, sustaining Scalzo's immunity; Minucher filed the present petition raising two principal issues: (1) whether the doctrine of conclusiveness of judgment/res judicata precluded the CA from resolving the appeal differently after G.R. No. 97765, and (2) whether Scalzo was entitled to diplomatic immunity (or other immunity) barring the civil suit.
- The Supreme Court considered documentary and testimonial evidence showing Scalzo was a U.S. DEA agent assigned to the Philippines during the relevant period and that there was official communication between the U.S. Embassy and the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs regarding his status and the assertion of immunity.

## Issues

1. Did the doctrine of conclusiveness of judgment (res judicata) following this Court's decision in G.R. No. 97765 preclude the Court of Appeals from resolving the subsequent appeal in a different manner?  
2. Is Arthur Scalzo entitled to diplomatic immunity (or otherwise immune) from civil suit for the acts alleged by petitioner?

---

## Ruling

1. No - The prior decision did not conclusively resolve the issue of diplomatic immunity; the question required further factual and evidentiary determination.  
2. No - Diplomatic immunity, as such, was not conclusively established on the record; Yes - however, Scalzo is entitled to the defense of state immunity from suit because he acted within his official functions with the imprimatur of the Philippine government.

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi

- Res judicata requires finality, valid jurisdiction, a judgment on the merits, and identity of parties, subject matter and causes of action. The Court found that G.R. No. 97765 did not finally determine diplomatic immunity because the private respondent had reserved the right to present documentary evidence and the authenticity and sufficiency of the diplomatic notes remained unresolved (citing Minucher v. Court of Appeals, 214 SCRA 242).
- The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations grants absolute immunity only to "diplomatic agents" (heads of missions and members of the diplomatic staff). The Court emphasized that accreditation and performance of "diplomatic functions" are the main tests; certain attaches and other mission staff may lack diplomatic rank and blanket immunity (citing the Convention and doctrinal sources).
- Post litem motam issuance of diplomatic notes and belated certification raise questions of authenticity and adequacy; courts must be circumspect when executive branch documents are issued after the litigation has begun.
- Evidence showed Scalzo was a United States DEA agent assigned to the Philippines during the relevant period and that he conducted surveillance and acted as a poseur-buyer, and that Philippine law enforcement participated in the operation. The official exchanges between the U.S. Embassy and the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs and the participation of Philippine narcotics officials indicate the Philippine government gave its imprimatur (if not explicit consent) to Scalzo's activities in-country.
- Under international law doctrine, a foreign state is immune from suit for acts performed in a sovereign capacity (state immunity). Where an agent acts within the scope of official functions on behalf of a foreign state, suit against the agent may amount to suit against the state (citing United States of America v. Guinto, 182 SCRA 644; World Health Organization v. Aquino, 48 SCRA 242).
- Limiting principle: immunity does not extend to acts outside authority, acts done maliciously or in bad faith, or unauthorized acts which are private in nature (citing Shauf v. Court of Appeals, 191 SCRA 713 and Director, Bureau of Telecommunications v. Aligaen).
- Applying these principles, the Court concluded Scalzo acted within his assigned DEA functions and with the host government's imprimatur; therefore he could invoke state immunity from suit. Consequently, Minucher's petition was denied.

## Doctrine / Legal Principle

- Res judicata requires final determination on the merits and does not bar reexamination where a prior decision left a factual or evidentiary issue unresolved.  
- Diplomatic immunity under the Vienna Convention applies only to diplomatic agents performing diplomatic functions; attaches and other mission staff may not automatically enjoy full diplomatic immunity.  
- Post litem motam diplomatic notes and certifications are subject to scrutiny as to authenticity and sufficiency.  
- State (sovereign) immunity applies to foreign agents acting within the scope of official duties; suing such agents may be tantamount to suing the foreign state.  
- Immunity is not available for unauthorized, malicious, or purely personal acts beyond official authority.

---

## Disposition

- The petition is DENIED.  
- Effect: The Court of Appeals' judgment sustaining respondent Scalzo's immunity and dismissing the complaint is left in effect insofar as respondent Scalzo is entitled to the defense of state immunity from suit.  
- No costs were awarded.

## Concurring / Dissenting Opinions

## Significance / Notes

- Clarifies distinction between diplomatic immunity (diplomatic agents under the Vienna Convention) and state immunity invoked for agents acting in an official capacity.  
- Emphasizes that accreditation, the nature of duties performed, and the host state's imprimatur/consent are central to any immunity claim.  
- Warns against unquestioning acceptance of post litem motam diplomatic communications; courts must assess authenticity and timing.  
- Affirms that immunity cannot be used to shield acts that are unauthorized, malicious, or beyond the scope of official functions.  
- Practical implication: plaintiffs suing foreign agents or representatives must develop evidence on the agent's status, the nature of acts (official vs. personal), and any host-state consent.
