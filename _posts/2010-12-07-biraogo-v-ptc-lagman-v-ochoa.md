## Facts
- On July 30, 2010, President Benigno S. Aquino III issued Executive Order No. 1 creating the Philippine Truth Commission (PTC), a body tasked to investigate reports of graft and corruption during the previous administration and to make recommendations to the President, Congress, and the Ombudsman.
- EO 1 declares the President’s continuing authority to reorganize the Office of the President and provides funding and staff for the Commission, including budget, staff, procedures, and hearings open to the public.
- The petitioners challenge EO 1 on multiple grounds: violation of separation of powers (creation of a public office by the President; allocation of funds), violation of the equal protection clause (targeting only the “previous administration”), and alleged usurpation of the Ombudsman’s and DOJ’s powers; they also seek injunctive relief.
- The consolidated petitions focus on the constitutionality of EO 1, particularly its creation of a new public office within the President’s domain and the scope of the Commission’s authority.
- The Court addressed standing, the appropriate limits on presidential power to create offices or bodies, the nature of the Commission (investigative vs. quasi-judicial), and the interplay with the Ombudsman and DOJ, as well as the equal protection implications of singling out the previous administration.

## Issues
1. Whether petitioners have legal standing to challenge Executive Order No. 1.
2. Whether Executive Order No. 1 violates the principle of separation of powers by usurping the powers of Congress to create public offices and to appropriate funds.
3. Whether Executive Order No. 1 supplants the powers of the Ombudsman and the DOJ.
4. Whether Executive Order No. 1 violates the equal protection clause by singling out the previous administration.
5. Whether petitioners are entitled to injunctive relief.

---

## Ruling
1. Yes — Petitioners have legal standing, including transcendental importance in Biraogo’s case, and, for Lagman et al., as members of the House of Representatives, as institutional actors whose prerogatives may be affected.
2. No — The Court did not sustain that EO 1 validly usurps Congress’s power to create public offices; the controlling concern on the majority’s side centers on equal protection rather than a workable separation-of-powers justification.
3. No — EO 1 does not supplant the Ombudsman or the DOJ; the Court views the Commission’s function as advisory/fact-finding to aid, not replace, the primary prosecutorial and investigative roles of the Ombudsman and DOJ.
4. Yes — EO 1 violates the equal protection clause; the classification of the Commission’s target as the “previous administration” constitutes an unlawful, invidious distinction not germane to a legitimate governmental objective, and the mandate cannot be sustained.
5. Yes — Petitioners are entitled to injunctive relief; EO 1 is enjoined to cease and desist execution to the extent of the equal protection violation.

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi
- Standing: The Court reaffirmed that standing in public interest challenges may be relaxed when issues are of transcendental importance or when protecting constitutional prerogatives of institutions such as Congress. In Biraogo, petitioners’ challenge implicated the Constitution’s allocation of powers and the integrity of governmental processes.
- Power to create public offices: The Court recognized that, under the 1987 Constitution, Congress ordinarily creates public offices, and presidential power to reorganize is limited to reconciling the Office of the President’s internal structure. The majority rejected expansive reliance on PD 1416 and related instruments, finding EO 1’s creation of a new public office (the Truth Commission) beyond the President’s delegated reorganization authority.
- Inherent executive power and checks: The Court acknowledged the President’s power to investigate and to ensure faithful execution of laws but held EO 1’s scope to be unconstitutional where it created a parallel investigatory body with “truth-telling” capabilities that could impinge on the Ombudsman and DOJ’s primacy in criminal investigation and prosecution.
- Equal protection: The central thrust of the ruling was that EO 1’s targeting of the “previous administration” constitutes a classification that is not reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective, failing the rational-basis test or any stricter standard. The Court rejected arguments that the distinction was necessary due to time, resources, or urgency, concluding that such prioritization cannot justify a constitutionally impermissible discrimination.
- Effect on due process and the justice system: The majority warned against the “truth-telling” framework that could prematurely shape public perception and influence other branches of government, potentially compromising the presumption of innocence and the integrity of the ongoing criminal justice processes.
- Doctrinal synthesis: The decision reaffirmed limits on executive power to create public offices, cautioned against “independent” bodies outside constitutional control, and underscored that constitutional rights require equal protection of the laws, including protection from arbitrary classifications and political bias in the governance process.

## Doctrine / Legal Principle
- Judicial Review and Separation of Powers: Courts may strike down executive actions that infringe constitutional boundaries, including attempts to bypass established legislative or judicial processes.
- Equal Protection: Classifications must be reasonable, with substantial distinctions, germane to the purpose, not merely incidental or time-based, and applied to all similarly situated persons.
- Public Office Creation: Creation of public offices is generally a legislative function; executive branch restructurings cannot amount to creating new public offices absent lawful delegation.
- Public Accountability vs. Due Process: The state’s pursuit of accountability must be balanced against the rights of individuals and the integrity of the criminal justice process, including presumption of innocence and fair trial protections.
- Advisory vs. Adjudicatory Power: Investigative bodies that usurp quasi-judicial or prosecutorial functions risk undermining constitutional distributions of power and the independence of primary investigative agencies.

---

## Disposition
- Forthwith, the petitions are GRANTED.
- Executive Order No. 1 is declared UNCONSTITUTIONAL insofar as it is violative of the equal protection clause of the Constitution.
- Respondents are ordered to cease and desist from carrying out the provisions of EO No. 1.

## Concurring / Dissenting Opinions
- Separate opinions were issued by:
  - Chief Justice Corona (concurring/dissenting considerations on the independence and structural implications of EO 1).
  - Justice Bersamin (separate views on locus standi and the public office question).
  - Justice Carpio Morales (separate opinion emphasizing equal protection and the proper scope of constitutional review).
  - Justice Nachura (separate concurring/dissenting view on the scope of executive power and separation of powers).
  - Justice Brion (separate concurring opinion addressing due process and the “truth-telling” framework’s implications for the judiciary and public perception).
  - Justice Perez (separate concurring opinion evaluating the nature of truth commissions and the constitutional framework).
- The opinions collectively illustrate a spectrum of views on executive power limitations, the role of truth commissions, and the balance between accountability and due process.

## Significance / Notes
- Constitutional Boundaries: The decision reinforces that executive-issued bodies cannot unconstitutionally duplicate or supersede constitutional offices such as the Ombudsman and the DOJ, nor can they be insulated from legislative control.
- Equal Protection as Central Guardrail: The case demonstrates that classifications in executive actions must pass rational basis review; arbitrary targeting of a past administration can render an involved executive action unconstitutional.
- Implications for Future Truth Commissions: While truth commissions exist in international practice, their creation in the Philippines must align with constitutional divisions of power, provide due process safeguards, and avoid undermining primary investigative and prosecutorial institutions.
- Policy and Governance: The ruling emphasizes the need for transparency and accountability mechanisms within the constitutional framework, ensuring reforms occur within the rule of law and with appropriate checks and balances.
- Public Administration: The decision clarifies that the President’s power to reorganize does not authorize creation of new public offices outside constitutional or statutory authorization, and that the fiscal and procedural safeguards must conform to constitutional allocations.
