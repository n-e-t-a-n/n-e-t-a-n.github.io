## Facts

- Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park (TRNP) consists of two coral atolls and Jessie Beazley Reef, part of Cagayancillo, Palawan. Proclaimed a National Marine Park by Proclamation No. 306 on August 11, 1988, and inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993.
- Republic Act No. 10067 (Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park Act of 2009), enacted April 6, 2010, established a "no-take" policy, created the Tubbataha Protected Area Management Board (TPAMB), and imposed regulatory and penal measures within TRNP.
- USS Guardian (an Avenger-class US Navy mine countermeasures ship):
  1. The US Embassy requested diplomatic clearance for the vessel in December 2012 for transit to Subic Bay.
  2. The ship left Sasebo, Japan on January 6, 2013 and arrived at Subic Bay on January 13, 2013.
  3. The USS Guardian departed Subic Bay on January 15, 2013.
  4. On January 17, 2013 at 2:20 a.m., while transiting the Sulu Sea, the ship ran aground on the northwest side of South Shoal of the Tubbataha Reefs.
  5. No crew injuries or oil/fuel leaks were reported; salvage operations were completed and the last piece removed by March 30, 2013.
- Petitioners (religious leaders, environmental groups, party-list representatives, labor and civic organizations) filed a petition on April 17, 2013 for issuance of a writ of kalikasan and a Temporary Environmental Protection Order (TEPO), alleging violations of R.A. No. 10067 and seeking various reliefs including cessation of operations, demarcation and buffer zone, rehabilitation, compensation, nullification of portions of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), and criminal, civil, and administrative actions.
- Respondents included US naval officers (Scott H. Swift, Mark A. Rice, Lt. Gen. Terry G. Robling) sued in official capacities, and multiple Philippine executive officials and agencies. Only Philippine respondents filed a consolidated comment; US respondents did not appear through pleadings and the US Embassy raised diplomatic transmission concerns.

## Issues

1. Do petitioners have standing to file the petition for a writ of kalikasan?
2. Does the Court have jurisdiction over the US respondents (Swift, Rice, Robling) in this suit given the doctrine of state/sovereign immunity?
3. Should the Court issue the writ of kalikasan and the requested TEPO to enjoin or restrain activities related to the USS Guardian grounding and to grant the substantive reliefs sought?
4. May this Court adjudicate and nullify provisions of the Visiting Forces Agreement in this proceeding?
5. Can the Court award damages to petitioners in this writ proceeding?
6. Is the petition or parts thereof moot because the salvage operations have been completed?

---

## Ruling

1. Yes - Petitioners have standing under the liberalized rules for environmental citizen suits as recognized in Oposa v. Factoran and embodied in the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases.
2. No - The Court lacks jurisdiction over the US respondents insofar as they are sued in their official capacities because of state/sovereign immunity (restrictive doctrine) and the suit would be, in effect, against the United States.
3. No - The petition for the writ of kalikasan and TEPO is denied; the Court will not enjoin the US respondents or grant the full reliefs prayed against them given immunity and related limits.
4. No - The constitutionality or nullification of VFA provisions is not properly raised or decidable in this special environmental proceeding; the VFA is a political/treaty matter and the petition is not the proper remedy.
5. No - The Rules on environmental cases do not permit the award of damages to individual petitioners in the writ; damages must be sought in separate civil actions or as provided under separate proceedings.
6. Yes - The request to enjoin salvage or post-salvage operations is moot insofar as salvage of the USS Guardian had already been completed at the time of filing; however, remedial directives regarding protection/rehabilitation by Philippine authorities remain cognizable.

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi

- Standing:
  - The Court reaffirmed the liberalized standing doctrine for environmental suits originating in Oposa v. Factoran, recognizing citizen and intergenerational suits. The Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases codify and permit citizen suits and representation of future generations.
- State Immunity and Jurisdiction:
  - The Constitution provides that the State may not be sued without its consent (Article XVI, Section 3). Precedent (United States of America v. Judge Guinto; Minucher v. Court of Appeals) reflects the doctrine that suits against foreign sovereigns or their officials acting in official capacity are barred absent consent; a judgment requiring appropriation by the foreign state is effectively a suit against the state.
  - The Court applied the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity: immunity covers jure imperii (sovereign acts) but not jure gestionis (commercial acts). The grounding and related acts were performed in official military capacity; satisfaction of any judgment would require action/funds of the US government, thus immunity bars suit against those US officials in their official capacities.
- UNCLOS and Flag State Responsibility:
  - Associate Justice Carpio's views, adopted in part, noted relevance of UNCLOS Articles 30–32 (non-compliance by warships and flag-state responsibility under Article 31) and Article 197 (cooperation to protect marine environment). Although the United States has not ratified UNCLOS, longstanding US policy and practice bind it to many customary norms; Article 31 imposes flag-state responsibility for damage caused by warships not complying with coastal-state laws. The Court recognized international responsibility under UNCLOS principles but found this did not negate sovereign immunity before local courts.
- Remedies under the Rules:
  - The Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases (Rule 7, Sections cited) limit reliefs under the writ (direct cease-and-desist, protection/rehabilitation orders, monitoring, reports, and other environmental reliefs) but exclude award of damages to individual petitioners in the writ itself. Separate civil, criminal or administrative actions are available for damages and fines (Section 17 and Section 15, Rule 7; Rule 10).
- Political Question and Executive Prerogative:
  - Issues implicating foreign relations, treaty interpretation, and international negotiations (including compensation and settlement with the US) fall within the competence of the political branches (Executive and Legislature). The Court deferred to the Executive on negotiation and settlement for compensation and rehabilitation measures.
- Mootness:
  - The Court agreed that injunctive relief to enjoin salvage operations was moot because the salvage was completed before the petition; notwithstanding, the Court recognized that orders to Philippine authorities to protect, preserve, and rehabilitate the affected reef remain cognizable and actionable.

Precedents and authorities cited in reasoning include Oposa v. Factoran; United States of America v. Judge Guinto; Minucher v. Court of Appeals; Shauf v. Court of Appeals; BAYAN v. Exec. Sec. Zamora; Nicolas v. Romulo; UNCLOS Articles 30–32 and 197; RA No. 10067; Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases (Rule 7, Sections 10, 15, 17; Rule 3 provisions on mediation).

## Doctrine / Legal Principle

- Liberalized standing for environmental suits: citizens (including minors and future generations) may file citizen suits for protection of a balanced and healthful ecology (Oposa doctrine; Rules).
- Foreign sovereign immunity applies to suits against foreign states and officials acting in official (jure imperii) capacity; restrictive doctrine limits immunity to sovereign acts.
- UNCLOS imposes flag-state responsibility for damage by warships failing to comply with coastal-state laws, but does not by itself abrogate sovereign immunity before domestic courts.
- Reliefs under a writ of kalikasan are primarily equitable and injunctive (protection, preservation, rehabilitation, monitoring) and do not include awards of damages to individual petitioners within the writ proceeding.
- Judicial restraint on matters touching on foreign relations and treaty interpretation; such matters are principally for the political branches and diplomatic negotiation.

---

## Disposition

- The petition for the issuance of the writ of kalikasan is DENIED.
- The Court declined to exercise jurisdiction over the US respondents (Swift, Rice, Robling) due to state/sovereign immunity.
- The Court will not grant damages to petitioners in this writ proceeding; damages and fines may be pursued in separate civil, criminal, or administrative actions as provided by law.
- The Court deferred to the Executive Branch on negotiation, compensation, and rehabilitation measures involving the United States.
- No pronouncement as to costs.

## Concurring / Dissenting Opinions

- Concurring Opinions were filed by Chief Justice Maria Lourdes P. A. Sereno and Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen.  
- Justice Antonio T. Carpio expressed views during deliberations regarding the applicability of UNCLOS and flag-state responsibility; the Court acknowledged those points in reasoning.  
- No dissenting opinion is noted in the decision.

## Significance / Notes

- Confirms and applies Oposa principle and the Rules' liberalized standing standard for environmental citizen suits, including representation of future generations.
- Clarifies limits of domestic courts to adjudicate claims against foreign sovereigns and their officials acting in official capacity; underscores the practical effect of state immunity in environmental disputes involving foreign warships.
- Recognizes relevance of UNCLOS norms (flag-state responsibility for warship-caused damage) while distinguishing international responsibility from domestic court jurisdiction and remedies.
- Reaffirms that compensation and interstate settlement for environmental harm involving foreign states are primarily diplomatic/political matters for the Executive to negotiate.
- Emphasizes procedural limits of the writ of kalikasan: equitable environmental reliefs are available, but awards of individual damages must be sought in separate proceedings.
- Encourages alternative dispute resolution and settlement (mediation, negotiation), noting precedents where the US settled reef-damage claims (e.g., USS Port Royal settlement).
- The decision illustrates interplay among environmental protection, international law, treaty obligations (VFA), sovereign immunity, and separation of powers in transboundary environmental incidents.
