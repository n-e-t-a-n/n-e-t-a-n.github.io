2. ## Facts
- The accused was convicted of raping his ten-year-old daughter; the offense was committed sometime in April, 1994.
- Republic Act No. 7659 (the Death Penalty Law) took effect on December 31, 1993; the accused was sentenced to death under that law.
- The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and death sentence on June 25, 1996.
- On July 9, 1996, the accused filed a Motion for Reconsideration contesting trial facts, including alleged ill motive of the victim's grandmother.
- On August 6, 1996, the accused discharged prior counsel Atty. Julian R. Vitug and retained the Anti-Death Penalty Task Force of FLAG.
- On August 23, 1996, FLAG filed a Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration raising grounds including:
1. Alleged bar to prosecution by pardon/affidavit of desistance by the offended party and her mother.
2. Vagueness of the complaint as to date of the offense preventing adequate defense.
3. Insufficiency of proof beyond reasonable doubt.
4. Alleged error in finding a parent/step-parent relationship as qualifying circumstance.
5. Alleged denial of due process and trial court bias.
6. Alleged incompetence of prior counsel (ineffective assistance).
7. Constitutional challenge to R.A. No. 7659 (a. death penalty excessive for crimes not resulting in death; b. death penalty cruel and unusual).
- At trial the victim admitted signing an affidavit of desistance but testified in open court that she was not withdrawing the charge.
- The Supreme Court considered which points could be raised for the first time on motion for reconsideration and limited review to matters properly before it, addressing jurisdictional concerns (affidavit of desistance) and the constitutional challenge.

3. ## Issues
1. Should the accused not have been prosecuted because of a pardon or affidavit of desistance by the offended party and her mother?  
2. Did the lack of a definite allegation of the date of the offense in the complaint and at trial prevent the accused from preparing an adequate defense?  
3. Was the guilt of the accused proved beyond a reasonable doubt?  
4. Did the Court err in finding that the accused was the father or stepfather of the complainant, thereby affecting imposition of the death penalty?  
5. Did the trial court deny the accused due process or manifest bias in the conduct of the trial?  
6. Was the accused denied effective assistance of counsel due to incompetence of prior counsel?  
7. Is R.A. No. 7659 unconstitutional per se:  
1. Is the death penalty excessive for crimes where death does not result (Article III, Sec. 19(1))?  
2. Is the death penalty cruel and unusual (Article III, Sec. 11)?

4. ## Ruling
1. No - The affidavit of desistance did not bar prosecution; the victim repudiated it in open court.  
2. No - Vagueness as to date was not a ground for relief when related defenses (alibi, denial) were raised at trial and on appeal.  
3. Yes - The Court found guilt proved beyond reasonable doubt based on positive identification and convincing prosecution testimony outweighing denial and alibi.  
4. No - The Court found no reversible error in the trial court's findings on parent/step-parent relationship as a qualifying circumstance.  
5. No - No sufficient proof that the trial court denied due process or manifested bias.  
6. No - Prior counsel was not shown to be grossly incompetent; ordinary diligence and appropriate steps were taken.  
7. No - R.A. No. 7659 was held constitutional as enacted; (7.1) No - the statute may validly impose death for crimes not resulting in death when constitutionally authorized; (7.2) No - the death penalty is not per se cruel and unusual under the Constitution in the circumstances presented.

5. ## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi
- Procedural scope: The Court adhered to the rule that matters not raised below generally cannot be first raised on appeal or in a motion for reconsideration; it nonetheless entertained jurisdictional issues (affidavit of desistance) when properly raised.
- Affidavit of desistance: The victim testified in court she intended to pursue charges despite signing a desistance affidavit; per People v. Gerry Ballabare and People v. Lim, a desistance affidavit is an additional ground and does not automatically negate trial testimony unless coupled with other circumstances creating reasonable doubt.
- Date vagueness and defenses: The accused had earlier presented alibi and denial defenses at trial and before the Court on automatic review; the supplemental argument raised no new matter warranting reversal.
- Counsel competence: The rule that a client is bound by counsel's negligence is qualified by an exception for gross incompetence (citing Suarez v. Court of Appeals). Prior counsel here attended hearings, filed briefs and motions, and exercised ordinary diligence; no showing of gross incompetence or prejudice was made.
- Guilt beyond reasonable doubt: The Court relied on positive identification and convincing prosecution testimony, finding denial and alibi insufficient to overcome the evidence.
- Constitutionality of R.A. No. 7659:
  - Text and legislative history: Article III, Section 19(1) of the 1987 Constitution allows Congress to re-impose the death penalty "for compelling reasons involving heinous crimes." The Court reviewed the Constitutional Commission debates and the congressional proceedings (House and Senate debates, committee reports) leading to R.A. No. 7659.
  - Definition of "heinous": The Act's preamble and statutory language describe heinous crimes as those grievous, odious, hateful, inherently wicked, vicious, atrocious or perverse and repugnant to societal norms; the Court found this description sufficient and deliberately flexible to allow judicial assessment of heinousness where the Act prescribes reclusion perpetua to death (flexible penalty) or mandates death in specified circumstances.
  - Distinction of offenses: The Court analyzed which offenses in R.A. No. 7659 carry discretionary reclusion perpetua to death versus mandatory death in specified qualifying situations; it held Congress may identify crimes and qualifying circumstances in line with Article III, Sec. 19(1).
  - Death penalty as constitutional: The Court surveyed Philippine precedent (Harden v. Director of Prisons; People v. Limaco; People v. Camano; People v. Puda; People v. Marcos) that has not held capital punishment per se cruel or unusual, and distinguished U.S. authority:
    - Furman v. Georgia addressed arbitrariness in imposition and not an absolute proscription of capital punishment; the Philippine statute and R.A. No. 7659 include procedural and substantive safeguards to reduce arbitrariness.
    - Coker v. Georgia (U.S.) addressed proportionality in the U.S. context and legislative trends; the Court declined to adopt the U.S. legislative-based rationale that rape categorically cannot warrant death, emphasizing differing cultural and legal considerations and the constitutional text allowing Congress to act on "compelling reasons involving heinous crimes."
  - Rape as heinous: Citing People v. Cristobal and statutory language, the Court held rape can be a heinous crime and that imposition of death in specified circumstances (e.g., victim age, relation of offender, resulting insanity or homicide, aggravating facts specified by statute) is constitutionally permissible.
- Safeguards: The Court noted procedural and substantive safeguards in R.A. No. 7659 (e.g., differentiated penalties, qualifications, automatic review) mitigate risks of arbitrary imposition.

6. ## Doctrine / Legal Principle
- Issues not raised at trial or on appeal generally cannot be raised for the first time on a motion for reconsideration.  
- An affidavit of desistance by a victim does not automatically bar prosecution where the victim retracts or pursues charges in court; desistance is an additional consideration, not conclusive.  
- A client is bound by counsel's acts or omissions except where gross incompetence prejudices the defense.  
- Under Article III, Section 19(1) of the 1987 Constitution, Congress may re-impose the death penalty "for compelling reasons involving heinous crimes"; Congress may define "heinous" and specify qualifying circumstances.  
- The death penalty is not per se a cruel and unusual punishment under the Philippine Constitution; proportionality and safeguards are key to constitutional validity.  
- Legislative history and congressional findings bear on constitutional evaluation of penal legislation but do not alone determine judicial review; courts assess statutory definitions, prescribed safeguards, and application.

---

7. ## Disposition
- The Motion for Reconsideration and the Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration were DENIED for lack of merit.  
- The conviction and the death sentence previously affirmed by the Court remain in force.  
- The Court upheld the constitutionality of R.A. No. 7659 as applied in this case.

---

8. ## Concurring / Dissenting Opinions
- Three members of the Court dissented on the constitutionality of R.A. No. 7659 insofar as it reimposes the death penalty.  
- Two of the dissenting members filed Separate Opinions attached as annexes; the authorship of those Separate Opinions was not indicated in the resolution consistent with the Court's policy in death cases.

---

9. ## Significance / Notes
- Confirms that, under Philippine law, Congress may re-impose the death penalty pursuant to Article III, Section 19(1) of the 1987 Constitution, provided the statutory scheme addresses "heinous crimes" and contains procedural and substantive safeguards.  
- Establishes that an affidavit of desistance by a minor victim is insufficient to bar prosecution where the victim repudiates withdrawal in open court; desistance is supplementary evidence, not dispositive.  
- Clarifies standard for counsel ineffectiveness: ordinary negligence insufficient; gross incompetence causing prejudice is required to overturn conviction.  
- Affirms that proportionality analysis and statutory safeguards (including delineation of qualifying circumstances and automatic appellate review) are central to constitutional assessment of capital statutes.  
- Reflects the Court's reliance on legislative history and debates in assessing whether Congress acted within its constitutional grant to re-impose capital punishment, while reserving to the judiciary the review of statutory application in individual cases.
