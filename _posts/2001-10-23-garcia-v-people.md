## Facts
- In 1983, Fidelino Garcia, Leopoldo Garcia, and Wilfredo Garcia were charged with murder in Criminal Case No. 2307-G, arising from a July 30, 1983 incident in Barangay II, Mulanay, Quezon. An earlier charging document for Fidelino, Leopoldo, and Wilfredo Garcia (Criminal Case No. 2307-G) was supplemented by a separate case, Criminal Case No. 2165-G, for direct assault upon an agent of a person in authority.  
- On December 13, 1983, an Information alleged that, on or about July 30, 1983, the three accused, armed with a knife, a piece of wood and a broken bottle, with intent to kill and taking advantage of their superior strength and with treachery, attacked and inflicted multiple injuries on Paulino Rodolfo y Olgena, causing death by cerebral hemorrhage. The Information did not expressly allege conspiracy or acting in concert.  
- On July 30, 1983, around 14:30 hours, P/Cpl. Francisco Rollera observed Fidelino Garcia, Wilfredo Garcia, and Leopoldo Garcia ganging up on Paulino Rodolfo y Olgena near the police outpost in Mulanay. Leopoldo held the victim; Fidelino hit him with an empty bottle; Wilfredo stabbed Paulino with a balisong; the knife got stuck in the victim’s body; Paulino wrested the knife and used it to stab Fidelino in the stomach. Rollera tried to intervene, fired three warning shots, but the fight continued. Paulino then stabbed Wilfredo twice in the neck and stomach, and Rollera, with others, attempted to pacify the scene. Fidelino was chased around a parked vehicle; he pursued Rollera with a broken bottle. Policemen arrived, pacified the affray, and Paulino Rodolfo subsequently died.  
- A medico-legal certificate allegedly showing the cause of death as cerebral hemorrhage was cited (Exhibit "B"); however, Exhibit "B" was not sufficiently present in the records, and its authenticity and admissibility were disputed. The defense described Fidelino as not being the aggressor and as having been attacked himself; the prosecution’s key witness, Rollera, gave inconsistent versions of Fidelino’s role.  
- On 14 February 1992, the trial court acquitted Fidelino Garcia in Criminal Case No. 2165-G (Direct Assault Upon An Agent of a Person in Authority) and convicted him along with Wilfredo and Leopoldo Garcia in Criminal Case No. 2307-G for homicide, sentencing them under the Indeterminate Sentence Law to an imprisonment ranging from 6 years and 1 day to 12 years and 1 day, with solidary indemnity to the heirs of Paulino Rodolfo y Olgena. The Court of Appeals later affirmed the conviction, with a modification in the indeterminate sentence to a range of 6 years and 1 day to 14 years, 8 months, and 1 day.  
- Fidelino’s separate appeal to the Supreme Court contends that (a) conspiracy was not alleged in the information nor proven at trial, (b) there was no evidence establishing the victim’s death or Fidelino’s connection to it, (c) the appellate court gave undue weight to the prosecution’s evidence, and (d) Fidelino should be acquitted as a principal, co-conspirator, or accomplice.

## Issues
1. Did the Court of Appeals err in convicting Fidelino Garcia as a conspirator in the killing of Paulino Rodolfo y Olgena?  
2. Was there sufficient evidence to establish Fidelino Garcia’s guilt with moral certainty?

---

## Ruling
1. No — The conviction for conspiracy cannot stand because conspiracy was not alleged in the information nor proven at trial. The information did not contain explicit language of conspiracy or acting in concert, and conspiracy must be pleaded or proven by overt acts to bind an accused to acts of co-accused. The appellate court erred in inferring conspiracy from the general charging language.  
2. No — There is insufficient evidence to prove Fidelino Garcia’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The record failed to show a direct link between his acts (e.g., hitting the victim with a bottle) and the fatal injuries, and the missing medico-legal certificate (Exhibit B) undermines the prosecution’s proof. The evidence does not establish Fidelino’s participation as principal, conspirator, or accomplice in the homicide.

## Reasoning / Ratio Decidendi
- Conspiracy must be expressly alleged in the information or proven by overt acts; an indictment using general terms without explicit conspiracy language does not suffice to convict someone as a conspirator. The Rules require a clear description of the charge to enable a proper defense and to prevent later duplicative prosecutions. A conviction cannot be grounded on inferred conspiracy absent explicit pleading or proven conduct showing concerted action. The Court cited Sec. 1, Rule 115 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure and related jurisprudence (e.g., People v. Quitlong) to emphasize the necessity of informing the accused of the nature and cause of the accusation and the need for appropriate conspiracy language in the information.  
- On sufficiency of evidence, the Court found a lack of direct and personal participation by Fidelino in the actual killing. The prosecution’s main eyewitness testimony presented inconsistencies about Fidelino’s exact role, and the evidence did not establish that Fidelino’s act caused or contributed to the death. The medico-legal certificate (Exhibit B) was not admissibly proven within the record, and the record does not confirm the existence or admissibility of that exhibit; the trial and appellate courts relied on an exhibit that was not properly before them. The presumption of innocence and the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt compel the acquittal where the connection between the accused’s acts and the death remains unproven. The Court reaffirmed standards from cases such as Pecho v. People and Maing v. People regarding the necessity of solid, corroborated evidence for conviction.

## Doctrine / Legal Principle
- Right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation (due process) — sec. 1(b), Rule 115 of the Rules of Court.
- Conspiracy must be pleaded or proven by overt acts; mere implied or inferred conspiracy from ordinary charging language is insufficient.
- An information must convey the particular circumstances that render an accused criminally liable, including acts and degree of participation; liability for co-accused requires direct and personal participation, unless conspiracy is established.
- Presumption of innocence; conviction requires proof beyond reasonable doubt; circumstantial or conjectural evidence cannot substitute for direct proof.
- Exhibits and medico-legal documentation must be properly admissible and proven; missing or improperly admitted exhibits cannot be used to sustain a conviction.
- Appellate scrutiny may override lower court findings if there are material inconsistencies or missing essential elements (e.g., causal connection between acts and death).

---

## Disposition
- The petition is GRANTED. The Court of Appeals’ February 22, 1996 decision in CA-G.R. No. 13358, affirming the trial court’s conviction, is reversed and set aside on the ground of insufficiency of evidence to convict Fidelino Garcia beyond reasonable doubt. Fidelino Garcia is acquitted and ordered released from confinement unless held for another lawful cause.

## Concurring / Dissenting Opinions
- None stated. All justices concur in the judgment acquitting Fidelino Garcia.

---

## Significance / Notes
- Reaffirms that conspiracy must be expressly pled or clearly proven; conviction cannot rest on inference from joint activity without explicit conspiracy language or proven overt acts.
- Highlights the critical importance of maintaining complete, admissible evidentiary records (e.g., medico-legal certificates) to support conclusions about cause of death and the relationship between specific acts and the victim’s death.
- Emphasizes the due-process requirement to distinguish acts personally attributable to the accused from the acts of others, especially in joint trials where multiple defendants are charged for a single homicide.
- Serves as a caution against relying solely on eyewitness testimony when it contains inconsistencies or fails to connect the accused’s actions to the fatal outcome.
