**This is not a substitute for reading the original source material, and only serves as an additional tool that can aid in the learning process**.

### ðŸŽ¯ Mission
- To simplify jurisprudence for better learning  
- To provide free, organized, and accessible digests  
- To build a community of learners who help each other succeed
